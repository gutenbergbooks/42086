<h1 title="">The Boy Scouts at the
<br />Panama-Pacific Exposition.</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">TWO SCOUTS ON A MOTORBOAT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, Rob, I ought to know that old
tub of a motorboat we&rsquo;re overhauling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Andy, it&rsquo;s Captain Jerry Martin&rsquo;s
<i>Sea Gull</i>. Time was when she had a reputation
for speed, but her engine is a back number now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! that must have been away in Noah&rsquo;s
time, I reckon, Rob. Why, we could make circles
around her, if we chose to drive our little
<i>Tramp</i> to the limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we happen to be in no hurry to-day, there&rsquo;s
no use making the old skipper feel that his boat
is down and out. With vacation opening up
before us, I&rsquo;ve been trying to settle on some
scheme for the scouts of the Eagle Patrol to
have a rousing good time this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know where I&rsquo;d be if I had the cold
cash to pay my expenses; and, Rob, chances are
you feel the same way about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I suppose you&rsquo;re thinking of Tubby
Hopkins&rsquo; great good luck in having his uncle,
Dr. Mark Matthews, the famous globe-trotter,
carry him off three days ago for an extended trip
to the big show out in California?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what was on my mind, Rob. I don&rsquo;t believe
I ever wished so much for anything as a
chance to hike away out to the Pacific. Nothing
comes my way any more, seems like. Some
of us scouts were lucky enough to have our turn
down in Mexico that time Tubby&rsquo;s uncle was
taken sick, and couldn&rsquo;t get there to meet his old
friend, General Villa, so as to dispose of the
cattle on his ranch before they were stolen by
the raiding Mexican rival armies. How the
rest of the boys envied us that glorious trip,
Rob!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I admit it was a rare streak of good fortune
to have things come our way as they did,&rdquo; the
boy named Rob remarked, as he gave a slight
turn to the wheel of the bustling little motorboat,
aboard which he and Andy were the sole passengers.
&ldquo;We ran up against quite an interesting
bunch of experiences, you remember, Andy, that
none of us will ever be apt to forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough fun for Tubby and
Merritt and you,&rdquo; continued the boy called Andy
at the wheelsman, &ldquo;it came about that you all
got a chance to go across the water to England
and Belgium late last summer on an important
mission for Merritt&rsquo;s family, and saw a heap of
what was going on in the fighting zone where
the Germans are up against the armies of France,
Belgium and Great Britain.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve shaken hands with ourselves dozens
of times since, I give you my word, Andy, on
account of that fine streak of luck. Yes, we did
encounter a whole lot of remarkable adventures
over there, and saw sights we&rsquo;ll never forget.
Some of them I wish I could put out of my
mind, because they were mighty unpleasant. But
that page is turned down, Andy; and now the
next thing to consider is what we are going to
do this summer to make the time pass happily.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t complain,&rdquo; Andy
Bowles continued, trying to smile away the discontented
frown that had settled across his forehead.
&ldquo;Here, in this good old Long Island town
of Hampton, there are lots of ways a pack of
lively up-to-date Boy Scouts can have good
times during vacation. With the big bay at our
doors, and a bully little motorboat like this to
go fishing or cruising in, there&rsquo;s no reason for
us not to be hustling most of our spare time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rob Blake went on to add, wishing to
soothe the ruffled spirit of his comrade, &ldquo;and
you know what glorious camping trips we can
have with a lot of the boys, just as we used to in
other summers. There is the full Eagle Patrol,
except our fat chum, Tubby, who&rsquo;s gone to see
the sights of the Panama-Pacific Exposition,
and Merritt Crawford, who expects to be away
for a month and more with his folks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; continued Andy Bowles, as though
the fact gave him more or less solid satisfaction,
&ldquo;all the other patrols are full&mdash;eight each
in the Hawk, the Black Fox and the Badger,
with a new one forming in the bargain. Boy
Scout activities are at flood-tide around Hampton
these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One reason for that, I take it,&rdquo; mused the
skipper of the little <i>Tramp</i>, &ldquo;is the fact that
through our activities in the past we have managed
to keep our troop in the public eye, more
or less. People know what the Eagles have
done, and on the whole they favor their boys
joining the newer patrols. There&rsquo;s been a big
change in the young fellows of Hampton, I&rsquo;m
told, since this Boy Scout movement first came
to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young leader of the Eagle Patrol
made this modest assertion, he certainly hit the
truth squarely on the head. During the last
two years the members of the Eagle Patrol had
made a name for themselves in Boy Scout annals&mdash;as
the new reader will find out for himself
if he cares to read the earlier books of this
fascinating series.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Among other things they had, through a
happy chance, become associated with certain
scientific gentlemen connected with the United
States Government, who were experimenting
with a new and secret model for a big airship
patterned somewhat after the famous Zeppelins
of the Germans.</p>
<p>On another occasion they had been enabled
to assist in saving the design of a wonderful
submarine, also intended for the use of the Government,
and the secret of which it appeared was
coveted by emissaries of a nation supposed to be
hostile to the United States, and desirous of
learning all about such an important discovery
that was apt to play an important part in future
ocean warfare.</p>
<p>Some of the scouts later on were given a
chance to pay a visit to the wonderful canal that
was then being dug across the Isthmus&mdash;at Panama;
and the record of how they made themselves
exceedingly useful while down there will always
be a bright page in the history of the Hampton
Troop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Mention has already been made by Andy
Bowles, the bugler of the troop, of the trip to
Mexico, with its attendant adventures; and also
of the foreign tour undertaken by several of the
Eagles on the previous summer, just when hostilities
had broken out between the nations of
Europe; and Belgium, where they were compelled
to visit, was torn from end to end with
the mad struggles of warring factions.</p>
<p>Yes, surely the Eagles could rest upon their
laurels from this time on, and history would
accord them the laurel wreath as the most enterprising
patrol known to the Boy Scouts of
America.</p>
<p>Still, what boy is ever satisfied with what has
happened in the past? The present and the near
future is what engages his attention and excites
his interest. Even sensible Rob Blake secretly
sighed when he contemplated having to put in the
whole summer around the home town while
Tubby Hopkins was having such a glorious time
out there on the Coast; and his other chum, Merritt
Crawford, was up in Canada with his folks at
a camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>It was a beautiful and warm day in the early
summer. The sun shone from an unclouded sky,
but there was enough sea breeze to fan their
heated brows, and to make them think that there
could be few things equal to being in a speedy
little motorboat, spinning over the surface of
that lovely land-locked bay, with the ocean booming
on the outer edge of the sandy strip to the
south.</p>
<p>They could have quite an extended view from
far out in the bay, with the houses scattered
along the shore, and the white sails of pleasure
craft or fishing and clamming boats dotting the
water far and near.</p>
<p>Just ahead of them the old launch that had
seen better days was churning up the water with
its noisy propeller, though not making remarkable
headway at that. As the two scouts gradually
drew up on the <i>Sea Gull</i>, they made out
that besides the ancient skipper there was just
one passenger aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Andy Bowles presently, as this
person chanced to turn his face toward them
by accident, &ldquo;that must be the old gent I saw
drop off the nine-thirty train from New York
this morning when I was heading for your
house. Yes, and now I think of it, I heard him
ask Dan Trotter at the station where Judge
Collins lived, and how he could get to his house
at the Point.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some friend of the Judge, then,&rdquo; suggested
Rob; &ldquo;and I guess he has a host of them here
and abroad; for he&rsquo;s wealthy, and interested in
all sorts of scientific matters. They say that at
his city house in the winter he entertains, at
times, all the big guns from the different colleges
of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me, Rob. There was an odd
twang in this old fellow&rsquo;s manner of speech
that made me think of Sandy Ferguson, the
Scotchman who has the bagpipes, you remember,
and always insists in marching in all the parades
in Hampton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, perhaps, he&rsquo;s some famous Scotch professor,&rdquo;
observed the skipper of the <i>Tramp</i>,
&ldquo;who wants to see the judge so much that he&rsquo;s
chased away out here to his summer home on
invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has a red face, wears big glasses, and
is scrawny enough for a Scotchman, anyway,&rdquo;
chuckled Andy, &ldquo;but do you know I always like
to listen to one of the Highland folks talk. It
was the &lsquo;burr&rsquo; in his speech that made me stop
and listen as far as I did. He&rsquo;s got it down
pat, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything more now, Andy; we&rsquo;re
drawing up pretty close, and he might not like
it if he thought we were talking about him. That
old motor does make lots of noise, but sometimes
it misses, and then there&rsquo;s a lapse, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re heading straight for the Point
where the Collins Castle is located, you notice,
Rob, so I guess Cap. Jerry is ferrying him
across. I only hope the old tub doesn&rsquo;t take a
notion to founder before it gets to the dock a
mile away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s stood lots of pounding, and only
has to be bailed out frequently on account of
leaking like a sieve,&rdquo; Rob said in a low tone.
&ldquo;Jerry has all that down to a fine point, and
just once in so often he gets busy and lowers
the bilge water with the pump he keeps rigged
handy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me from running around in such a
trap,&rdquo; muttered Andy, who was rather inclined
to be &ldquo;fussy&rdquo; with regard to everything he handled,
and tried to have his possessions kept up
to top-notch condition&mdash;what he himself called
&ldquo;apple-pie shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The professor is like most Englishmen, for
he loves his pipe,&rdquo; remarked Rob, as he watched
the passenger aboard the old launch filling his
little black pipe with tobacco taken from a rubber
pouch. &ldquo;I hope, when he strikes that match,
and then throws it away after lighting up, he
knows enough about motorboats to see that it
goes overboard, and not into the bottom of the
craft. Sometimes a leak will spread a film of
gasolene over the bilge water, and there&rsquo;s always
more or less danger of an explosion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Andy seriously, &ldquo;there have
been a number on the bay the last three seasons,
and two people that I can remember were so
badly burned that they died after being rescued.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Both of the boys watched with more or less
interest, and possibly with suspended breath,
while the red-faced passenger in Captain Jerry&rsquo;s
old launch puffed several times at his pipe, then
tossed the match aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it didn&rsquo;t go overboard, for a fact, Rob!&rdquo;
gasped Andy; but there was no time to say another
word, for suddenly they saw a flash of
flame spring up aboard the old <i>Sea Gull</i>, and
in an instant it seemed as though the launch
was aflame from stem to stern!</p>
<div class="img" id="p018"><img src="images/p018.jpg" alt="Suddenly they saw a flash of flame spring up aboard the old Sea Gull." width="500" height="694" /></div>

<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">PROMPT WORK, AND A RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>Fortunately Rob Blake had wonderful presence
of mind in a sudden emergency. Some
boys would have been so badly shocked by what
was happening near at hand, that for the time
being, they must have been unable to make any
move toward rendering first aid to the afflicted.</p>
<p>No sooner did the leader of the Eagle Patrol
see that terrible outburst of fire than he started
his little motor on at full speed, heading straight
toward the imperiled launch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! get hold of that fire extinguisher we
carry!&rdquo; he called out to his companion, who
was staring, with open mouth and awe-filled eyes,
at the scene of commotion close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rob, will the fluid put out a gasolene
fire?&rdquo; exclaimed Andy, though at the same time
hastening to throw back the lid of a locker and
snatch out the brass tube which had been lying
there for just such a time of sudden need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s one of its best uses,&rdquo; Rob told him
hastily. &ldquo;It seems to form a coating over everything
it touches that the fire can&rsquo;t break through.
It kills fire. That&rsquo;s where it gets its name. Be
ready now to make use of it when we come up
as close as I dare go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of the men are overboard, Rob!&rdquo; announced
Andy excitedly, &ldquo;and hanging on to
the side of the boat. Wow! but isn&rsquo;t she blazing,
though? I can begin to feel the fierce heat
even here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready to get busy now!&rdquo; cried the skipper,
as he manipulated his engine in such a way as
to reverse the propeller, and bring the <i>Tramp</i>
to a stop close to the blazing launch.</p>
<p>Andy was no coward, and could keep a pretty
level head when it came down to doing things;
though often he had to be told what to attempt
by someone more masterful than himself. As
soon as Rob shouted to him to start operations,
he worked the fire extinguisher with might and
main, and was considerably astonished to discover
that just as Rob had said, wherever the
magical fluid struck, it seemed to dishearten the
conflagration, for the flames immediately died
out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop! it&rsquo;s doing the whole business, that&rsquo;s
right, Rob!&rdquo; cried the pleased amateur fire-fighter,
as he continued to make judicious use
of his apparatus. &ldquo;Why, I tell you nothing can
hold out, Rob, against this dandy contraption.
Look at it do the work, will you? Oh! it&rsquo;s sure
worth its weight in gold when you need something
to save your boat with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, to judge from the magical way in
which the threatening fire was extinguished
aboard the old launch, Rob Blake had certainly
made no mistake when he purchased that little
fire-fighting contrivance, even though it did
cost him close on ten dollars.</p>
<p>Rob, seeing that all danger of the fire communicating
to the <i>Tramp</i> was now past, slowly
started toward the other boat. His intention
was to rescue the two elderly men who were in
the water. To tell the truth, Rob was very much
afraid the passenger may have been seriously
burned, and that in his panic he might release
his frenzied grip on the gunwale of the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>It turned out otherwise, however, for Scotch
grit held good, and Rob soon had the satisfaction
of helping both men aboard the <i>Tramp</i>.</p>
<p>They had received a number of burns, and
presented rather a peculiar appearance, since
their eyebrows and beards had been badly
singed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire&rsquo;s all out, Rob!&rdquo; announced Andy, at
this juncture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then fix it so that we can tow the <i>Sea Gull</i>
behind us,&rdquo; the other told him, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll change
our course for the Collins Point yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is verra kind of ye to go to all that
trouble,&rdquo; remarked the elderly man, looking the
young skipper of the rescuing boat over from
head to toe, &ldquo;and I wull not be the one to forget
the favor, I assure you, my fine laddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not seriously burned, sir?&rdquo;
remarked Rob, who saw that there were signs
of the other&rsquo;s clothes having been afire before
he tumbled overboard, possibly urged to this
last resort through the energetic efforts of old
Captain Jerry Martin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope not myself,&rdquo; replied the
other, as he felt of his body, and then put up
a hand to his blackened face. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve
been well singed, and that until I grow a new
crop of eyebrows I will look like a scorched rat;
which is verra unfortunate, since I am on a most
important errand over in your country. But,
indeed, I should be ashamed to complain, for it
might have been a deal worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about you, Captain Jerry?&rdquo; asked
Rob, turning to the subdued looking old skipper
of the disabled motorboat, who had once been
an oysterman, though of late years rheumatism
had compelled him to seek another less strenuous
means for making a living on the famous
bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nawthin&rsquo; to count much, Rob,&rdquo; grunted Captain
Jerry, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll jest hev to git
a new engine aboard the <i>Sea Gull</i> arter this accident.
I knowed she leaked a mite in the connectin&rsquo;
feed pipe, but I never thought anybody
would throw a lighted match down <i>thar</i>! I&rsquo;m
glad to be alive still; and I hopes as how the
duckin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to fotch on my rheumatiz
agin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;m altogether to blame for the accident,
Captain,&rdquo; said the passenger, &ldquo;I shall insist on
doing my part toward helping you put in that
new motor. The chances are I will be marooned
at my friend&rsquo;s place now for weeks, until I&rsquo;m
presentable; though what&rsquo;s to be done about getting
that valuable shipment out to our exhibit
I am unable to say. Perhaps Judge Collins may
be able to help me decide. It&rsquo;s a verra odd time
to introduce myself, laddies, but I want to know
more of ye, and so permit me to say I am Professor
Andrew McEwen, from Edinburgh
University, Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Robert Blake, and my father is
connected with the bank at Hampton. My chum
here is of the same name as yourself, professor,
Andrew; but his last name is Bowles. I
think his family came originally from Scotland.
We are Boy Scouts, and out for a little
cruise just to pass the time away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which was a lucky thing for myself, I am
sure,&rdquo; remarked the elderly gentleman, as he
squeezed a hand of each of the young fellows.
&ldquo;And if you will land me at Judge Collins&rsquo; dock,
you will increase the obligations under which
you have placed me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are heading straight that way, sir,&rdquo; Rob
told him.</p>
<p>Somehow he liked the stranger from the start.
He had shrewd, gray eyes that had been wont,
no doubt, to twinkle under bushy eyebrows; but
with these now missing his thin face had an almost
comical appearance. Still, there was a
kindly expression to be detected there, as well
as the keen look of a savant. And from the
way in which Professor McEwen from time to
time watched Rob, it was evident that he had
also conceived a great fancy to the fine, manly
looking boy who seemed to be able to master a
crisis so ably.</p>
<p>Presently they drew in at the dock, where
Judge Collins was awaiting them. From the
fact that the gentleman gripped a pair of marine
glasses in his hand, and had an anxious look
on his face, Rob jumped to the conclusion that
he must have been on the lookout for the coming
of the celebrated scientist from abroad, and
might have witnessed the details of the accident
and the rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dinna doobt but that ye will have some difficulty
in recognizing me, Judge Collins,&rdquo; called
out the Professor, falling back more than ever
into his Scotch dialect in his mingled amusement
and chagrin. &ldquo;My ain brother wouldna know
me with this blackamoor face, <i>sans</i> eyebrows,
<i>sans</i> beard, and fortunate to have saved my eyesight.
I am a fearsome sicht, and feel unco&rsquo;-unpleasant
in the bargain. But thanks to these
braw laddies we were saved from a watery
grave, for which baith feel thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come up to the house at once and
wash up,&rdquo; said the judge feelingly. &ldquo;Then I
shall ease any suffering with some magical pain
extractor that I chance to have and can recommend.
No, please stay with me a little while,
boys, unless you are in a great hurry. I want
to hear your side of the story as well. And Captain
Jerry, what can I do to make you comfortable?
An old sailing mate of yours is in the
boathouse at work, and if you will join him
shortly I will send something comforting out to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Rob looked at Andy, who nodded his approval
of this idea. Andy had never before met with
a chance to see the inside of the judge&rsquo;s house
on the Point, which, being built of stone, and
boasting a few turrets, had come to be called
the &ldquo;Castle&rdquo; by most of the baymen. Such a
golden opportunity might not come along again;
and, besides, they certainly were in no hurry,
so they could oblige the judge without putting
themselves out at all.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward they found themselves in
the library. Rob had been here before and even
spent some hours examining the myriads of curious
things among the collections which Judge
Collins kept at his country house, where he spent
more than half the year entertaining visitors.</p>
<p>Here the judge made an examination of the
burns of the little Scotch scientist. It was found
that beyond a few painful red marks, and the
loss of the hair that had once been on his face,
Professor McEwen was all right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>He seemed to take his mutilation greatly to
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would ha&rsquo;e been peetifu&rsquo; eno&rsquo; at any time
to be transformed into such a scarecrow as this;
but think of me on the way out to join some of
my fellow workers in the avenues of science,
and taking with me the balance of our delayed
valuable exhibit. Aweel, aweel, the best laid
plans o&rsquo; mice an&rsquo; men gang aft aglee. I shall
ha&rsquo;e to hide my diminished head until Nature
restores my looks. Ya maun rest assured I
shall not let my friends see me in this way;
they wouldna doobt but that it was the Missing
Link come to light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; said the judge impulsively,
&ldquo;to have you stay with me as long as
you can spare the time, Professor. It will gladden
my heart more than I can tell you, for the
profit is bound to be all on my side.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But whatever am I to do aboot getting that
exhibit out to our concession at the Exposition,
now that I shall be utterly unable to attend to
it myself? I wish I could solve that problem;
my own discomfort I wouldna consider so much.
In fact, I have undertaken this trip under protest.
I care not a rap or a bawbee as to whether
I see the Exhibition or not, if only I could make
positive that my errand had been successfully
carried out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you can send what you are taking
there by express, and it will arrive safely?&rdquo; suggested
the judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I gave my solemn word,&rdquo; expostulated
the Scotch professor, who seemed to possess all
of the stubborn qualities with which those of
his land are said to be afflicted, &ldquo;not to let the
valuable packet go out of my possession for a
minute, unless I gave it in charge of an equally
responsible messenger. Money would be no object,
judge, I assure you, if only you could find
me a gude mon; nane ither would I trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge seemed to be pondering. When
Andy caught him looking in a serious fashion in
the direction of himself and comrade, somehow
he felt a queer thrill pass through his system,
though he did not exactly know why it should
be so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Then he saw a smile begin to creep over the
face of Judge Collins, as he nodded his head
slowly. Whatever had flashed into his mind,
it seemed to afford him considerable satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor McEwen,&rdquo; he said slowly, but earnestly,
&ldquo;if you are looking for some trustworthy
persons to whom you can delegate your mission,
and do not mind what expense there may
be attached to carrying it out, I believe I can
suggest a couple of dependable young chaps who
might fill the bill; they are the wide-awake Boy
Scouts who were concerned in your rescue this
very morning. How would you like to talk over
that business with Rob Blake and Andy Bowles,
here, Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">WHEN LUCK CAME THEIR WAY.</span></h2>
<p>Andy fairly held his breath in suspense when
Judge Collins made that astonishing suggestion
to the little Scotch professor. He had always
known that the judge was a firm believer in the
uplift of the Boy Scout movement, for he had
never failed to assist the Hampton Troop by
every means possible. That he would go so far
as to recommend two of the scouts to his friend
as responsible enough parties to be entrusted
with such an errand filled Andy with both
amazement and delight.</p>
<p>Professor McEwen&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as he surveyed
first the boys and then their earnest sponsor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ha&rsquo;e no doobt but that they are responsible
and trustworthy, just as ye say, Judge Collins,&rdquo;
he proceeded to remark presently, with
lines of perplexity visible across his forehead,
&ldquo;and if it were but an ordinary errand I
wouldna hesitate a single instant aboot entrusting
it to them. But I ha&rsquo;e to consider well before
makin&rsquo; up me mind. The property belangs
to ithers than mesil&rsquo;, ye ken; and it is of a scientific
value beyond compare. In fact, it could
not well be replaced if lost in transit; money
wouldna be any consideration in exchange,
which is why I wouldna wish to send it by express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be kind enough to listen while I relate a few
facts concerning this same Rob Blake, and a
couple of his friends,&rdquo; said the judge, smiling,
and shaking his head at Rob when he thought
the latter looked as though about to protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be unco&rsquo; pleased to hear all you can
tell me,&rdquo; declared the scientist, &ldquo;for I must confess
that from the verra beginning these braw
lads ha&rsquo;e made a most favorable impression with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Rob had to sit there, squirming rather
uneasily, while the judge told of the perilous trip
he and several chums had made to the troubled
republic of Mexico, and how they had cleverly
managed to accomplish the delicate mission with
which they had been entrusted by Tubby Hopkins&rsquo;
uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Then he took up the subject of the tour
abroad, where they had been for days and weeks
in the battle zone of the contending armies, managing
with consummate skill to avoid complications,
and eventually succeeding in attaining
the object which had been the cause of their
undertaking this perilous mission.</p>
<p>All this while the little Scotch professor
sucked away at his pipe as though he found great
consolation in burning the weed that originally
came from Virginia in the time of Sir Walter
Raleigh, and was therefore a strictly American
product. Now and then he would let his shrewd
eyes roam from the face of the enthusiastic
judge to the burning one of Rob Blake, and at
such times Andy always noticed that he would
nod slightly, as though better pleased than ever.</p>
<p>Andy, by the way, was enduring all manner
of torture on account of the suspense; he had
had a glorious prospect opened up before him,
if only the curtain would not suddenly fall and
shut it out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is not nearly all that these gallant boys
have done,&rdquo; declared the narrator, after a time.
&ldquo;I could sit here for an hour and tell you innumerable
instances where Rob, and some of
his chums into the bargain, did things that would
be counted big under ordinary conditions. Why,
it has come to that pass in Hampton nowadays
that when anything beyond the ordinary is attempted
they have to get the scouts interested
in it first, and then people begin to believe it
must have some merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you tell me is indeed wonderful,&rdquo; declared
the professor. &ldquo;After that recommendation
I am strongly disposed to offer them the
carrying out of my mission if they could see their
way clear to accept the task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would give them a chance to spend some
weeks at the Exposition without incurring any
expense, is that the idea, Professor McEwen?&rdquo;
asked the judge, who looked as happy as though
he had discovered some wonderful bug which
had been eagerly sought after for years and
years by all scientists and collectors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a month, if they cared to stay that
long,&rdquo; replied the other, who seemed to have
been fully convinced, and ready to throw the
load of responsibility from his own shoulders
to those of Rob and his chum. &ldquo;The particulars
can be gone over a little later, either to-night,
if they care to see me again, or to-morrow.
There is no great need o&rsquo; haste, though
what I am carrying out to California is being
eagerly expected by my colleagues there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me congratulate you, boys, on your good
fortune,&rdquo; said the kindly judge, as though he
wished to settle the matter in such a fashion
that there could be no drawing back on the part
of the gentleman. He then shook hands first
with Rob and then with Andy Bowles.</p>
<p>Rob was looking a little pale from excitement,
but there was also a happy glow in his eyes.
As for Andy, he could not prevent a wide grin
from spreading over his features. His father
owned a livery stable in Hampton, but was not
considered at all well-to-do, so that the boy
had never been able to do more than dream of
taking expensive trips. That one down into
Mexico had come like a gleam of golden sunshine,
for Tubby Hopkins&rsquo; old uncle had footed
all the bills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do I understand you to make this proposition
to us, Professor McEwen?&rdquo; Rob asked
bluntly, not wishing to be laboring under any delusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aweel, aweel, I dinna ken how I could do
better; and I feel that I am indebted to ye baith
for my life. After hearing what bonny lads
ye are, from my friend Judge Collins here,
whose opinion carries great weight wi&rsquo; me, I am
mair than pleased to offer to stand all the cost
of a trip to California and back; as well as the
expense which you will necessarily be under
while seeing the great Exposition in San Francisco.
Do ye think ye can ha&rsquo;e the permission of
the auld folks to take so lang a journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no trouble on that score, Professor,&rdquo;
urged the judge. &ldquo;These lads have so
amply demonstrated their sterling ability to look
out for themselves that I really believe Rob&rsquo;s
parents would not object if he wanted to go to
hunt for the South Pole, or explore the unknown
regions of tropical Brazil. And so we shall call
it settled, I presume, Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ha&rsquo;e made the offer, and shall tak&rsquo; it hard
if they turn it down,&rdquo; said the peculiar little
man of science, whose name, Rob afterward
learned, was known throughout the whole length
and breadth of the world wherever men of intellect
gathered to discuss their theories and discoveries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as we are concerned,&rdquo; said Rob, after
receiving an entreating look from the excited
Andy, &ldquo;we are disposed to accept right on the
spot, subject to the reservation that our parents
may have the final deciding of the matter. We
will run over here by moonlight to-night, Professor,
and if everything is satisfactory, we will
talk matters over with you, and make all arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me nicely, laddie,&rdquo; declared the
visitor pleasantly; &ldquo;and I shall ha&rsquo;e to think mysel&rsquo;
unco&rsquo; lucky to have found competent and
trustworthy messengers so soon after the necessity
arose. I shall look for ye then this same
evening; and I hope that there may be no barrier
thrown in the way of your acceptance of my
offer. The mair I see of ye the better satisfied
I feel that I will ha&rsquo;e no regrets after entrusting
my mission in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon afterward the two scouts said good-by
to the professor, and started down to the dock.
Even in his distress of body and mind, the
thoughtful scientist had not forgotten Captain
Jerry; and the boys were entrusted with a message
to him to the effect that ten pounds awaited
his acceptance when he was ready to install that
new three-horse-power engine in his launch.</p>
<p>The old bayman was glad of the chance to
have his wrecked boat towed back home; and
when Rob delivered the message of the professor,
the look of concern on his weatherbeaten face
vanished as the mist does with the coming of
the sun.</p>
<p>All the way across the broad bay the two
scouts were jabbering to each other in connection
with the astonishing streak of good fortune
that had just come their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I must be dreaming!&rdquo; Andy declared
for the fourth time. &ldquo;Please give me a
pinch, Rob, to let me make sure I&rsquo;m awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;ll get used to it by degrees,&rdquo; the
other told him, though he felt somewhat uncertain
himself at times, and had to convince himself
that it had all actually happened, and was
not the result of a fevered imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk to me about luck,&rdquo; continued Andy rapturously,
&ldquo;there never could happen again such
a wonderful combination of things. First, that
the feed-pipe aboard the <i>Sea Gull</i> should be leaking
a trifle; second, that Professor McEwen
was aboard the same; then he tossed that lighted
match the wrong way, so instead of going
overboard it fell down and slipped between the
bars of the wooden grating into the oil-covered
bilge water, and last of all that we chanced to
be close by at the critical moment, ready fixed
with a fire extinguisher to put out the blaze, and
capable of hauling the ship-wrecked mariners
aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything of that kind is always a combination
of minor happenings that seem to dovetail
in with each other,&rdquo; Rob explained. &ldquo;In this
case it worked perfectly. All other boats were
so far away that there&rsquo;s no telling what might
not have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting close in now, and, Rob, there&rsquo;s
somebody waving to us from the dock. Why, it
looks like our inventor chum and fellow scout,
Hiram Nelson, the queerest fellow in the Eagle
Patrol. He must want us to stop and take him
out for a ride on the bay. You didn&rsquo;t promise
him anything like that, did you, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, not that I remember,&rdquo; replied the
other slowly; &ldquo;but now that you mention him
acting as though he wanted to see us so badly,
I remember that Hiram has been talking to me
several times lately about some wonderful secret
he was carrying around with him. He said he
hoped to be in a position soon to open up and
take me into his confidence; and that he might
have a proposition to make that would give me
a great, though a pleasant shock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo; chuckled the happy Andy.
&ldquo;Well, seems to me the shoe is on the other foot
just now, and that we&rsquo;ve got something to tell
Hiram that will take his breath away for a minute.
Look at him dancing around, Rob! I suppose
now he&rsquo;s gone and invented some sort of
contraption that never can be made to work,
and he wants to tell you he&rsquo;s saved up enough
hard cash to get a patent on the same. But
chances are it&rsquo;ll be money wasted, because, so
far as I know, nothing Hiram has done so far
has proved much of a success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little afraid it&rsquo;s as you say,&rdquo; added
Rob, in a low tone, for they were now fast nearing
the dock where the other boy waited for
them, his face wreathed in such broad smiles
that they could easily see his news was of a pleasant
nature. &ldquo;Three times Hiram has tried to
go up in that a&euml;roplane of his and failed. I hope
he&rsquo;s switched his genius off on some safer track
than this sky traveling. But we&rsquo;ll soon know,
for here we are at the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy stood by with the boathook to fend off,
and old Captain Jerry got in readiness to take
charge of his launch and pole it along the border
of the bay to the mouth of the creek, up which
he had his mooring place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>When Rob had made the motorboat fast to a
cleat on the dock, he joined his chum, and the
two of them advanced toward the spot where
Hiram awaited their coming, his face still betraying
the great excitement under which he
seemed to be laboring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">A STUNNING SURPRISE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly looks all worked up, doesn&rsquo;t he,
Rob?&rdquo; Andy remarked, as he and his companion
found themselves drawing closer to the other
scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiram is a queer stick, you remember,&rdquo; the
patrol leader told him, speaking in a soft tone,
as he did not wish the other to catch what he
said. &ldquo;Everybody just knows that he&rsquo;s gone
daffy over this craze to invent something worth
while. But unless I miss my guess we&rsquo;re going
to hear some news shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no chance to exchange further remarks,
because they had reached a point close
to Hiram. The latter was a rangy sort of chap.
He could talk as well as the next one when he
felt disposed that way, but it had always been
a sort of fad with Hiram Nelson to pretend
that he was a <i>real</i> countryman, and many a
time had he amused his chums with his broad
accent and his wondering stare, as of a &ldquo;yahoo&rdquo;
seeing city sights for the first time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Now, however, Hiram apparently was not
bothering his head about having any fun with
his fellow scouts. There was an eager expression
on his face, as though he were bursting
with the desire to communicate his great secret
to a chosen few of his chums, especially to the
patrol leader, Rob Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been alookin&rsquo; for you all over town, Rob,&rdquo;
he started in to say, as they joined him. &ldquo;Took
me an awful long time to get track of where
you&rsquo;d gone. Then just by accident I ran across
Walter Lonsdale, who told me he believed from
what Sim Jeffords said, that Joe Digby had seen
you and Andy here hitting it up for the dock,
and so he reckoned you must have gone off on
your little <i>Tramp</i>. And say, Walter was right
that time, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly was,&rdquo; replied Rob, while Andy
Bowles chuckled at the roundabout way the
other admitted he had received his information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Rob,&rdquo; continued Hiram mysteriously,
&ldquo;&rsquo;course you remember my telling you that sooner
or later I might have somethin&rsquo; of <i>vast</i> importance
to tell you, something that would give
you one of the greatest thrills ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I remember that,&rdquo; asserted the other,
&ldquo;what about it, Hi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other leaned closer to the scout leader,
and in a hoarse whisper exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time has come now, Rob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; said Rob. &ldquo;Fire away then,
Hiram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram cast a rather dubious glance in the direction
of Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind me one little bit, Hi!&rdquo; sang
out that worthy cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise to
seal my lips if you give the word, and even being
burned at the stake couldn&rsquo;t force me to squeal
a syllable. Say on, Hiram; you&rsquo;ve got Rob and
me worked up to top-notch with curiosity, and
I know I&rsquo;ll burst pretty soon if you don&rsquo;t take
pity on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, I guess it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the other observed
slowly. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;ll be knowing it
sooner or later. You just can&rsquo;t hide a light under
a bushel, anyhow. So I might as well take
you at your word, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My word&rsquo;s as good as my bond, Hiram,&rdquo;
said the bugler of the troop, with some show of
pride; whereat Hiram laughed softly, as though
possibly he had no reason to doubt that same
fact, since Andy would find it difficult work to
get anybody to accept the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down here on this pile of lumber,&rdquo;
Hiram went on to say, &ldquo;while I tell you what
wonderful things happened. The greatest
chance I&rsquo;ve ever struck so far, and you can understand
that I&rsquo;m nigh about tickled to death
over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! bet you&rsquo;ve gone and spent every red
cent you could scrape up paying a patent lawyer
to put some wildcat scheme through; and
that you&rsquo;ve got the papers in your pocket showing
that you&rsquo;ve parted from your hard cash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Andy recklessly said this Hiram turned
and looked reproachfully at him, and then with
his accustomed drawl remarked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything we tackle in this world is a
chance and a hazard, don&rsquo;t you know, Andy
Bowles? And if inventors, people who have
the big brains, and get up all the wonderful labor-saving
devices you read about, didn&rsquo;t choose
to accept risks, why whatever would become of
all you ordinary folks, tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it up, Hiram,&rdquo; he said blankly. &ldquo;But
please go right along and tell us what you&rsquo;ve
been and gone and done now. Never mind me.
My bark is a whole lot worse than my bite, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Hiram assured him cheerfully.
&ldquo;Well, you guessed right in one way, Andy, for
I have secured the advance notice that a patent
is pending on a clever invention of mine, which
is as good as saying it&rsquo;s secured. But that&rsquo;s
only the beginning, the foundation, or, as you
might say, the advance agent of prosperity. The
best is yet to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re exciting us a heap, Hiram, I admit,&rdquo;
muttered Andy, &ldquo;but I hope it isn&rsquo;t all going
to turn out a big smoke. There&rsquo;s some fire back
of this talk, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; the other told him grimly. &ldquo;Get
ready to soak in this information, boys. The
invention for which I have applied for patent
rights is, as p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ve already guessed, in
connection with airships!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited at that point, as if expecting some
expression of surprise and wonder; so not to disappoint
him, and in hopes of hurrying matters
along a little faster, the accommodating Andy
gave vent to the one expressive word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been tackling one of the hardest
propositions we inventors have ever run up
against,&rdquo; continued Hiram pompously, &ldquo;and to
tell you the truth it was only through a happy
chance that in the end I stumbled on the key
that unlocked the secret. You may know that
one of the obstacles to making a&euml;roplanes popular
among the masses has been the danger attending
these air flights. Even the most experienced
pilots are subject to risks that they
pretend to make light of. You understand all
that, Rob, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know they are delicate affairs at best
when used for sailing a mile above the earth,&rdquo;
admitted the patrol leader; &ldquo;and that a sudden
gust of wind, if it takes the voyager unawares,
is apt to bring about disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Hiram triumphantly.
&ldquo;Rob, I&rsquo;ve discovered a way to prevent all these
accidents, and made an a&euml;roplane as safe for a
novice to run as it would be for an experienced
pilot with a license.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have done that, Hiram, you&rsquo;ve got a
feather in your cap!&rdquo; Rob told him. &ldquo;Some of
the biggest inventors have been lying awake
nights trying to fix things that way, so as to take
away most of the terrible risk of flying; but so
far it doesn&rsquo;t seem they&rsquo;ve met with much success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till they hear from Hiram Nelson,
that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; declared the happy scout, as he smote
himself on the chest in rather a vainglorious
fashion, which, however, the other two boys
hardly noticed, for they knew Hiram&rsquo;s fondness
of boasting, as he had always been afflicted in
that way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us the rest, Hi,&rdquo; said Andy, just as if
it bored him to hear so much about the &ldquo;preliminaries,&rdquo;
when as the inventor proclaimed the
best was yet to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Hiram promptly. &ldquo;Now you
know what the scheme is I can go on and get
deeper into my yarn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you would,&rdquo; muttered Andy, pretending
to stifle a yawn back of his hand, but that
was only done in order to hurry the long-winded
talker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call my wonderful invention a stabilizer,
because that&rsquo;s the use it&rsquo;s really intended for,&rdquo;
continued Hiram, as though wishing to fully
impress that fact upon their minds. &ldquo;To tell the
truth, I&rsquo;ve had the legal documents showing that
a patent had been applied for, quite some time
now, though for reasons of my own I kept it
all a dead secret from everybody. Mebbe yeou
fellers may have noticed that I&rsquo;ve been looking
kinder mysterious the last month or two? Well,
guess with such a tre<i>men</i>jous secret on your
mind either of you&rsquo;d a been equally absent minded.
But that is past now, and I&rsquo;ve accomplished
my aim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Andy burst out with. &ldquo;Let go your
bowstring then and shoot, for goodness sake,
Hiram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course I had it all laid out,&rdquo; continued
the other composedly, as if it was beneath
him to pay any attention to these pins that Andy
was sticking into him, &ldquo;and my first thought was
to get in communication with some enterprising big
corporation that manufactured a&euml;roplanes
for the market. All inventors have to sell their
first few patents, you know, so&rsquo;s to get money
enough to push other ideas; and if I could pick
up a few thousand that way, why I&rsquo;d have to let
my stabilizer go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been corresponding with such a
company, have you?&rdquo; asked Rob, knowing that
he could tempt the other to hurry his story in
this way, just as a witness in court is drawn on
by a clever lawyer&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! several of them, in fact,&rdquo; admitted Hiram,
as if that were only a minor matter, after
all, &ldquo;but in the end I found that a certain concern
meant strictly business, and consequently I
dropped all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have they actually made you a definite offer
for your valuable invention?&rdquo; asked Rob,
taking considerable more interest in the matter,
now that Hiram&rsquo;s undoubted though erratic
genius seemed to be steadying down with some
tangible results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much that way, I should call it,&rdquo; remarked
the inventor, trying hard to appear natural,
though trembling all over with excitement.
&ldquo;They went so far as to enclose a check big
enough to cover all expenses of myself and a
companion&mdash;for I was smart enough to say I&rsquo;d
insist on having company for advice along with
me&mdash;to run out to their main works, and talk
the matter over with a view to disposing of my
patent rights to the device.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Andy&rsquo;s face lost the look of sneering
incredulity that had been a marked feature of
his listening to all this talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! is that a fact, Hiram?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Shake hands on it, will you? Didn&rsquo;t we always
say that some fine day you&rsquo;d be famous,
and make the Eagles proud to reckon you as a
member? A real check, and not on a sand bank,
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I went right away to Rob&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s
bank and saw the president. He said the check
was O. K. and that I could get the hard cash
any time I wanted it. Why, he even called it
a certified bank draft, which meant the money
had been set aside in the San Francisco bank
for that purpose, deducted from the account of
the Golden Gate A&euml;roplane Manufacturing Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; almost shrieked Andy Bowles, &ldquo;say
that again, will you, Hiram? Must be my mind&rsquo;s
so filled with that Golden Gate business I just
<i>thought</i> I heard you mention something like
that. Repeat it, please, Hiram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the check came from a San Francisco
bank, because you see the company is a substantial
concern in California. They make some
of the most famous a&euml;roplanes on the market.
If they adopt my stabilizer it&rsquo;s going to be heard
of all over the world. And to think what a magnificent
chance we&rsquo;ve got to run out there and
take in the great Panama-Pacific Exposition at
the same time, Rob! It&rsquo;s enough to make you
think you&rsquo;re dreaming, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you mention <i>me</i> in the game, Hiram?&rdquo;
demanded the patrol leader, with a smile
on his face, and a knowing wink in the direction
of Andy Bowles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, don&rsquo;t you see, Rob, I knew I didn&rsquo;t
have a business head on me, and might get cheated
out of my boots if I ran up against a smart
lot of manufacturers; and so I was wise enough
to insist that I be allowed to fetch along a companion.
They never put up a single kick against
the expense of the double bill, Rob; but the check
covered railroad fare, sleeper, meals, and hotel
bills while there a week, as well as the return
trip to boot. That means they fancy my invention
is going to be a big thing for their house.
And, Rob, don&rsquo;t you see, I had you in mind all
the while when I wrote about fetching a companion.
I want you the worst kind to accept
my invitation and go to the Fair at my expense.
Tell me you will, Rob!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">HEADED WEST.</span></h2>
<p>When he made this alluring offer Hiram Nelson
was astonished to see Rob turn toward
Andy, and that the pair of them actually
laughed. Quite indignant at such a showing
of skepticism, Hiram hastened to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe a word of what I&rsquo;m saying,
p&rsquo;raps now? Well, seeing that your dad reckoned
this little paper was worth every cent it
called for, suppose you take a squint at the
same, Rob. You, too, Andy, and then you&rsquo;ll laugh
on the other side of your mouth, I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flourished the bank draft in front of their
eyes, so that both scouts could see the amount
it called for in cash, and that it bore all the
marks of being genuine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! neither of us is doubting anything you
say, Hiram,&rdquo; explained Andy effusively. &ldquo;The
only thing is that Rob here can&rsquo;t accept your
generous offer, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t accept?&rdquo; gasped the other, looking terribly
disappointed. &ldquo;Why not, I&rsquo;d like to know;
and me countin&rsquo; on having him along to advise
me, and keep me from being caught napping, or
robbed of my valuable papers on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why he isn&rsquo;t able to take the trip
to California at your expense, Hiram,&rdquo; said
Andy solemnly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s already
pledged himself to go with someone else. Fact
is, Hiram, I&rsquo;m the one who holds Rob&rsquo;s word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;agoin&rsquo; to California, Andy Bowles?&rdquo;
exclaimed the astonished Hiram; and his incredulous
manner told that he doubted the truth
of the assertion, for where could the son of the
liveryman of Hampton get all the money to cover
the double expense of such a lengthy trip; certainly
not through any invention <i>his</i> brain had
ever conceived; and no boy could ever hope to
save enough out of his spending money for that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve just made all arrangements for a
month at the Exposition,&rdquo; said the Bowles boy;
&ldquo;that is, we have to run over to Judge Collins&rsquo;
place again after supper to-night, and complete
the details. We expect to pull out day after
to-morrow, and take a through limited train for
New Orleans first, then across the plains of
Texas, and the deserts of New Mexico and Arizona
to Los Angeles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram sat there as though changed into stone.
He hardly knew whether Andy was trying to
hoodwink him or not; for the other had something
of a reputation as a joker.</p>
<p>Rob took pity on the poor fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as Andy says, Hiram,&rdquo; he observed
seriously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a wonderful experience
when out on the bay. A fire happened aboard
old Captain Jerry&rsquo;s <i>Sea Gull</i> on account of a
passenger dropping a lighted match, so that it
caused something of an explosion. The two
men, somewhat scorched, tumbled overboard.
We were close at hand, and by using that fire-extinguishing
torch of mine managed to put out
the flames before they&rsquo;d done much damage. We
also hauled Captain Jerry and his passenger
aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; gasped Hiram. &ldquo;If it
don&rsquo;t take you to do wonders, Rob Blake. Go
on and tell me the rest, please. My yarn isn&rsquo;t
in the same class with yours, it strikes me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob quickly put him in possession of the facts
that followed fast on the heels of the rescue,
and their reaching the Castle of Judge Collins.
Hiram continued to shake his head, and draw in
long breaths as though almost overcome with
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Arabian Nights never was in it with the
things that happen to you, Rob,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
when the story was complete. &ldquo;And so both
of you are expecting to start overland to California
right away? Well, I&rsquo;ve got plenty of
money right here, and what&rsquo;s to hinder our making
it a party of three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That strikes me as a good thing, Hiram,&rdquo;
said Rob. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all scouts and comrades,
after all; and you say you are afraid you&rsquo;ll need
advice sooner or later in dealing with the manufacturers.
We&rsquo;ll stand by you, Hiram, and
there&rsquo;s my hand on it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Rob!&rdquo; cried the delighted inventor,
whose dejected countenance immediately
lighted up. &ldquo;I was mighty afraid you meant
to leave me out of the excursion party. Stand
by me, and I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to help you.
Three ought to be even better than just two,
when it comes to counting noses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made a remark just now that struck me
as queer,&rdquo; said Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what it was, then, and I&rsquo;ll try to
explain,&rdquo; Hiram ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you spoke of wanting a companion
along to keep you from being caught napping, or
robbed of valuable papers on the way; what did
you mean by the last part of that sentence?
Have you any idea anyone covets your papers,
and might make an attempt to rob you when
you were far away from home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob, p&rsquo;raps I&rsquo;m silly to think that way, but
I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; Hiram confessed. &ldquo;You see,
one of the companies I corresponded with was
in New York. They even sent an agent down
here to interview me, and see what I had got.
I never liked that man the least bit. He struck
me as a sneak, and I made up my mind the
company was what you might call a snide one&mdash;wanting
to steal ideas if they could. I declined
to have any dealings with them, and their
agent went away as mad as a hornet, even
threatening that he&rsquo;d get the better of me by
hook or crook.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; ejaculated Andy. &ldquo;Then,
you must have squeezed his toes, Hiram; you
made him squeal, and show his true colors. I
give you credit for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything from the company
since?&rdquo; asked Rob, hardly knowing whether
to treat the implied threat seriously, or only as
the ugly remark of a disappointed man who had
found that Hiram was too smart for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, every week I get a few lines from this
Marsters, the man who came to see me, asking
if I&rsquo;m ready to do business with him. There&rsquo;s
no threat in the letter, but there&rsquo;s always something
to imply that he&rsquo;s keeping track of what
I&rsquo;m doing, and expects sooner or later I&rsquo;ll be
glad to turn to him for a sale.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you are afraid that he even knows of
your dealings with this Golden Gate Company
out on the Coast, is that it, Hiram?&rdquo; continued
the scout leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; admitted Hiram.
&ldquo;One letter came that I know had been
tampered with. It may be he&rsquo;s got somebody in
our postoffice in his pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a serious thing if true,&rdquo; Rob
told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky they didn&rsquo;t keep out the letter that
had the bank draft in it,&rdquo; suggested Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might have done it,&rdquo; Hiram said, &ldquo;only
the company was smart enough to register that,
and it got to me safe and sound. But, Rob,
after all this might only be a big bluff Marsters
is putting up. He may never bother his head
about me starting off on this trip, even if he
hears about it through any paid spy in Hampton.
And if I&rsquo;ve got two good chums along
with me, who&rsquo;s afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; advised Rob, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better
keep this thing a dead secret. We&rsquo;ll agree not
to say a word about it to anyone. They can
know how Andy and myself have been lucky
enough to get a chance to see the Exposition;
and let people figure you&rsquo;re in the deal, too.
We&rsquo;ll do nothing to make it seem contrary, remember
that, Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on, all right, Rob,&rdquo; the other hastened
to assure him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; continued Rob, &ldquo;be careful with
that draft. If I were you I&rsquo;d hand it over to
my father, and then when you want the money
he&rsquo;ll give it to you. Did you think to ask him
not to mention it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he said he wouldn&rsquo;t, after I&rsquo;d shown
him the letter. He shook hands with me, Rob,
and said he was as pleased as pie about it&mdash;leastways
not in just those words, you know,
but it meant the same thing. I&rsquo;ll go up right
away and ask him to take charge of it for fear
I may lose the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After making arrangements to meet again in
the afternoon so as to talk matters over and
lay their plans for starting, the boys went home
for lunch. All of them, of course, were fairly
bubbling over with excitement; and when the
story was told of what had happened on the bay,
as well as the wonderful thing that came of the
rescue, in at least two Hampton homes there
were proud parents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Of course, no one put the least objection in the
way of Rob and Andy taking that wonderful
trip. They were thought to be the luckiest boys
in all Hampton; and when the news leaked out
every fellow in town flocked around to hear the
particulars.</p>
<p>That night after supper Rob and Andy rowed
over to Judge Collins&rsquo; and spent a very pleasant
evening with Judge Collins and his distinguished
guest. Professor McEwen went into
matters with a thoroughness that spoke well for
his business ability, in spite of the fact of his
being a scientist.</p>
<p>In the end it was all arranged. Rob and Andy
understood just what they were expected to do
in order to carry out the instructions of the Scottish
professor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come over to-morrow afternoon, lads, and
everything will be here ready for you to take
charge of,&rdquo; the satisfied gentleman told them as
they were saying good-night. &ldquo;The Judge ha&rsquo;e
kindly promised to see to things, sinc&rsquo; I&rsquo;m muckle
sore, and hardly in condition to show myself
in public. What I am giving into your charge
can be handily carried in your grip; only I ken
ye will want to be chained fast to the same all
o&rsquo; the time fra start to feenish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since there are so many things waiting to be
told that befell the boys later on, there is really
little need of our lingering any longer at this
point than is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>On the following afternoon Rob and Andy
paid their last visit to the Point, and when they
came away they carried a packet with them
which they seemed to guard most carefully.</p>
<p>Besides this Rob had in his possession plenty
of money to see them out to the Coast, as well
as a letter of credit on a San Francisco bank
that would insure a future supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you should need even more,&rdquo; Judge
Collins told Rob in parting, &ldquo;wire to me of your
necessities and it will be forthcoming, because
we are both determined that you brave lads shall
have the time of your lives while out there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The boys made all their arrangements, and
when the second morning rolled around there
was quite a host at the station to see them take
the morning train to New York, where they expected
to start upon the real journey.</p>
<p>Sleeping-car berths had been secured in advance
to New Orleans, and which would in fact
carry them all the way through, since it was not
their intention to stop over anywhere <i>en route</i>.</p>
<p>Among the relatives and friends who had assembled
to see the three scouts leave for the far-distant
Pacific Coast, were numerous members
of the Hampton Troop. Like Rob and Andy and
Hiram, these boys wore their khaki suits, and
seemed proud of the badges and medals they
had won the permission to sport.</p>
<p>Thanks to the caution suggested by Rob, no
one appeared to know just how Hiram came to
be in the fortunate bunch. Some accounts
coupled his name with the rescue of the famous
scientist who was visiting Judge Collins; while
others were just as firmly convinced that there
were only two on board the <i>Tramp</i> at the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>In the end it was set down as something of
a mystery which might not be cleared up until
the return of the travelers. They knew that Hiram
was a very secretive sort of fellow, and that
even if he accomplished something calculated to
fetch him in money, he would not tell of it until
he chose.</p>
<p>The train drew in at the station, and the three
scouts got aboard amidst a perfect clamor of
shouts, above which could be heard the well-known
scout salute. As the conductor gave the
signal for them to pull out there was a scene
such as had seldom been witnessed at Hampton;
which proved just how much Rob Blake, the
leader of the scouts, was appreciated in his home
town.</p>
<p>Hardly had they left the outskirts of the town
behind when Hiram, who was sitting just behind
Rob and Andy, leaned forward and said in a
low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dead sure about it, Rob, but there was
a man got aboard this train that looked a whole
lot like that tricky agent I told you about, Marsters!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">A FALSE ALARM.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, would you mind changing seats with
Hiram?&rdquo; asked Rob, upon hearing what the boy
behind him had just said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; there&rsquo;s plenty of room still,&rdquo; replied
the troop bugler, quickly slipping out and
allowing Hiram to take his place, while he leaned
forward over the back of the seat so he could
join in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it was this same man, Hiram?&rdquo;
asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only had a quick look at him, and his back
was toward me,&rdquo; explained the nervous inventor,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m most certain it was that agent. He
had a rather odd little limp you see, and this feller
did, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram had his hand laid upon his chest. Inside
his coat he carried the precious papers, and
just then the boy seemed to be more concerned
about these than he was in connection with the
pocketbook that reposed in a back pocket of his
trousers, or the tickets he had in another repository.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, keep close to both of us, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said
Rob. &ldquo;Even if it is Marsters, the chances are
he&rsquo;s only trying in his mean way to give you a
bad feeling. I don&rsquo;t expect we&rsquo;ll be bothered
with him after we get fairly started on our trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if he tried to steal my papers from
me?&rdquo; said Hiram uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have a hard time doing that, with one
of us on either side,&rdquo; affirmed Andy Bowles confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate a second to hand
him over to the police if he tried any of his
games on us,&rdquo; Rob added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be he&rsquo;s hired some smart pickpocket
to rub up against me when we get in the jam
at leaving the train,&rdquo; Hiram told them, showing
that his mind was active enough to grasp every
sort of possibility, no matter how vague.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll checkmate him on that easily enough,&rdquo;
chuckled Rob. &ldquo;In the first place, we don&rsquo;t mean
to allow ourselves to get caught in any jam.
When we draw into the station we&rsquo;ll sit tight
until most of the passengers have left. Then
Andy here can go and get the particulars as
to where our train is standing that will take us
South; for it&rsquo;s all one Pennsylvania station, you
know. And I&rsquo;ll stick close to you every minute
of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Andy went on to say, &ldquo;you know we&rsquo;ve
got something in Rob&rsquo;s grip that we have to
&lsquo;guard with unceasing vigilance,&rsquo; as Judge Collins
said, because it is of priceless value in the
eyes of scientists; and its safe delivery to the
head of the exhibit at the Fair will mean we&rsquo;ve
earned our trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on, when they finally left the car, Andy
hurried off to pick up the needed information.
They had a whole hour before the scheduled
time of starting came, so none of them were
anxious with regard to being left.</p>
<p>Hiram stood there with his bag between his
feet, looking to the right and to the left. He
seemed to be in constant fear lest some astonishing
surprise might be sprung upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There he is now, grinning at me like an
ape, Rob!&rdquo; he suddenly muttered, and his voice
was certainly anything but firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, that is your Marsters, is it?&rdquo; demanded
the other, as he discovered a slim man standing
at some little distance from them, and with a
satirical smile on his dark face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and don&rsquo;t you think he looks like he&rsquo;d
stop at nothing in order to get to the end he had
in view?&rdquo; asked Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like an impudent fellow to me,&rdquo; Rob
advised, &ldquo;and according to my mind he&rsquo;s gone to
all this bother just to feel that he&rsquo;s had his nasty
revenge on you for treating him so shabbily.
To be beaten in a battle of wits by a mere boy
must have riled Mr. Marsters a whole lot. Depend
on it, he doesn&rsquo;t expect to go any further
than this in the game. He&rsquo;s shot his bolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very fact that he&rsquo;s taking all the pains
to stand there and let you see him grinning like
an imp,&rdquo; replied the scout leader. &ldquo;Now, if
he really meant to chase after you on the trip,
don&rsquo;t you see he would be doing everything he
could to keep you from knowing he was around,
and on the watch?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Hiram, after he had been shown, began to see
it that way, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems as though there might be a good lot
of truth in that view, Rob,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;So
let him grin all he wants to. I&rsquo;ll laugh, too,
if only to show the feller that he hasn&rsquo;t made
me squirm a whit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that Hiram bent almost double, like a
hinge, and seemed to be tickled half to death
over some imaginary joke. He also turned and
looked straight in the eyes of the man he had
called Marsters, as if to let him know he did not
care a snap of his fingers about his continued
leering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve settled his case, and cooked his goose
for him,&rdquo; commented Rob, a minute later. &ldquo;See,
there he goes over yonder, and I&rsquo;ll be a whole
lot surprised if we set eyes on Marsters again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rob, I&rsquo;m determined to act as though I
fully expected him to be creeping around all the
time. I&rsquo;m playing up to the old saying that an
ounce of prevention is worth more&rsquo;n a hull
pound of cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; was all Rob told him, for
just then he saw Andy hurrying toward them,
and from his manner guessed the other must
have obtained the needed information.</p>
<p>Once they were settled in the sleeping-car,
Hiram began to feel better, though it might be
noticed that he eyed every person who came
aboard as though he more than half suspected
the revengeful Marsters, baffled in securing the
wonderful invention for his firm, might assume
some marvelous disguise in order to be near the
traveling genius, so as to rob him on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; exclaimed Andy joyously, as the
train started, drawn by an electric motor, and
heading through the tunnel that would take them
under the North River to Jersey, and thence
across the Hackensack Meadows to Newark and
beyond.</p>
<p>Everything looked bright and cheerful that
morning when the three scouts began their long
journey calculated to land them eventually inside
the portals of the big Exposition on the Pacific
Coast, and which was being held to commemorate
the opening of the Panama Canal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Certainly never before had Boy Scouts been
enabled to start forth upon a trip of such magnitude,
and under such happy auspices. With
all their expenses paid, and the grandest possible
time looming up ahead of them, it was not to
be wondered at that Rob and his two chums
counted themselves the luckiest fellows on the
face of the globe.</p>
<p>All of them were fond of traveling, and that
first day was a constant picnic for the scouts.
It happened that Rob and Andy had been over
the route before, since it was this way they had
gone to Mexico when with Merritt Crawford
and Tubby Hopkins. On that occasion they had
undertaken the carrying out of that mission connected
with the disposal of the cattle on the
ranch Dr. Mark Matthews, the globe-trotter and
explorer, owned across the Rio Grande, his old-time
friend General Villa seeing that he was
properly paid with the funds held by the Revolutionary
party.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>This being the case, they were able to direct
the attention of Hiram to many interesting objects
on the way. Hiram had never been a hundred
miles outside of Hampton in all his life;
and therefore he stared and commented continually
as the train rushed along through
stretches of the country around Washington and
beyond as the day drew near its close.</p>
<p>Remembering what Judge Collins, as well as
the Scotch professor, had told them in connection
with the contents of Rob&rsquo;s grip, they kept it
down at their feet constantly; for they had the
whole section, Andy having promised to occupy
the upper berth, as he knew Hiram would feel
safer in company with Rob below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen anything suspicious the
whole day long, have you, Hiram?&rdquo; Rob asked
him, as they prepared to go into the dining-car
for their supper, two at a time, and the third
staying to look after things, as well as keep his
foot on the precious grip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not that you could really call <i>suspicious</i>&rdquo;
admitted the other, &ldquo;but seemed like several
parties looked right hard at me as they
passed through agoin&rsquo; to that meal car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shucks!&rdquo; said Andy, leaning across from
his seat to speak in a low tone, &ldquo;that all comes
from you being worked up the way you are.
Chances are they must a&rsquo; seen the budding genius
breaking out all over your face in the shape
of freckles, Hiram, and wondered who on earth
you could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I always figger that it&rsquo;s best to be on
the safe side, no matter if other people do make
out to snicker at you, and call you timid. It&rsquo;s
poor policy to shut the door of the stable after
the hoss is stolen, my dad says; and your folks
would agree with me there, Andy, seeing that
they have a heap to do with hosses. Do I go
in with you to grub, Rob, or wait here for my
turn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave that with Andy,&rdquo; Rob remarked indifferently;
&ldquo;if he feels too hungry to stay here
for us to come back, let him take the first show.
Here comes the waiter to give the call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy immediately said that it pleased him to
wait and take his time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I like to be easy in my mind when I&rsquo;m trying
to get the worth of a big dollar in dinner,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;and if I keep on thinking of you
fellows counting the minutes while I&rsquo;m gone, it
hurries me too much; and that&rsquo;s bad for your
digestion, you know. So skip along, and I&rsquo;ll
hug the seat here till you get back. Make up
your mind, Rob, everything will be safe enough.
I&rsquo;m Johnny on the spot when it comes to standing
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this fashion all of them managed to get
their supper. The night closed in and the full
moon lighted up the wonderful scenery of the
valleys they were speeding through, headed
toward the southwest, and into the land of
sugarcane, oranges, cotton and rice.</p>
<p>Hiram, when he could take his mind away
from the fascinating prospect of doing a lucrative
business with the enterprising firm that had
invited him all the way out to the Coast, was full
of questions regarding the wonderful things he
expected to see later on when they reached a
section of the country that was radically different
from Long Island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>He had always wanted to visit the South, and
this culmination of his hopes filled him with
ecstasy. The presence of such a steady chum as
Rob Blake did much to add to Hiram&rsquo;s peace
of mind, it can be readily believed; for he felt
sure that no matter what troubles might spring
up to confront him on the journey, the efficient
scout leader would be equal to any emergency.</p>
<p>Hiram had the utmost confidence in Rob
Blake. It was founded on what he had seen
the other accomplish; and, besides, the things
he had heard concerning that Mexican trip, as
well as the journey across to the war zone of
Europe, had added to his respect.</p>
<p>All that night they boomed steadily on.</p>
<p>Rob slept with Hiram in the lower berth, and
occupied the side nearer the aisle, so as to ease
the nervous chum&rsquo;s mind as much as possible.
Like most new and inexperienced travelers, Hiram
hardly slept a wink that first night; much
of the time he had the window-shade drawn
back, and lay there staring at the ghostly objects
that could be seen flitting past the window&mdash;cabins,
trees, settlements, barns, orchards,
rivers and all manner of things the ever speeding
train was passing in its wake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>When morning finally came they were so well
along their way that the country had taken on
a new aspect, and Hiram&rsquo;s interest grew by
leaps and bounds. What was more, since he
could still feel that precious packet inside his
coat, where he had at Rob&rsquo;s solicitation pinned
it inside his pocket, Hiram&rsquo;s confidence became
much stronger, and the anxious look began to
leave his thin face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be in Los Angeles inside of five
hours, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram had kept his face glued against the
window so much of the time during the long
journey, when it happened to be closed, that
Andy told him he was getting a distinct curve
to his classic Roman nose. He turned on hearing
Rob make this assertion, after consulting
the time-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one, I must say I won&rsquo;t be sorry,&rdquo;
he admitted, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here, I thought you were having the
time of your life with all this traveling, and seeing
so many wonderful sights?&rdquo; expostulated
Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, I am,&rdquo; admitted Hiram.
&ldquo;Still, a feller can get too much of a good thing,
can&rsquo;t he? Haven&rsquo;t you stuffed yourself more&rsquo;n
once because you liked the food first-class, and
then wished afterward you had gone slow? Fact
is, I just can&rsquo;t sleep while we&rsquo;re ding-donging
along like hot cakes. I want to be on a steady
footing for a while, and go to bed like a civilized
human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s been a great trip,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;Those Injuns at the stations in Arizona were
real true-blood Zu&ntilde;is, all right. I&rsquo;m mighty
glad, though, we&rsquo;ve made up our minds to go
back by way of the Canadian Pacific road, so as
to see what the picturesque Selkirks look like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Rob, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read so much about
the Rockies up in British America I want to see
them with my own eyes. The weather will be
a whole lot better than in the southern zone,
where it&rsquo;s terrible in summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about coming back before
we&rsquo;ve even got there,&rdquo; expostulated Hiram,
looking unhappy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an awful lot to do
before I turn my face homeward. I hope it all
comes out right, and that the Golden Gate Company
acts square with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you get some money, Hiram, I suppose
it&rsquo;s all laid out before now in experiments that
you&rsquo;ve wanted to start and couldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Andy
hinted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what would you have me do with the
stuff?&rdquo; demanded the inventor indignantly. &ldquo;I
expect to devote my hull life to science. Hoarding
money and discoveries in the realm of science
don&rsquo;t go hand in hand. You&rsquo;ll notice that all
the big bugs of professors don&rsquo;t seem to care a
lickin&rsquo; thing about the cash they gain. What
they&rsquo;re after is fame and glory. Some day&mdash;but
never mind that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were going to tell us we might live to
see you famous, eh, Hiram?&rdquo; Andy chuckled.
&ldquo;Well, stranger things have happened. Men
have become president of these United States,
and those who played with the same as boys
never dreamed such a thing would ever come
about. There&rsquo;s always room at the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hours will soon pass,&rdquo; Hiram went on to
say, without paying any attention to the little
slur there seemed to be in this remark on the
part of the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I want to speak to you
about,&rdquo; said Rob, his face assuming a look of
gravity that impressed Hiram very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, me, do you mean, Rob?&rdquo; he asked
hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rob told him. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what it is. I&rsquo;ve
noticed that you keep on putting up your hand
every little while, and feeling to see that your
papers are safe inside your coat. It&rsquo;s become
second nature with you, the habit&rsquo;s grown so
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you told me to keep my mind on that
matter, and never to forget it; and so every
time it crops up I guess I feel to make doubly
sure. What is there wrong about that, Rob, tell
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this, Hiram; you&rsquo;re getting so careless
that you do it openly, and in such a way as to
attract attention. If a person happened to see
you do it once and then later on saw the movement
repeated, his curiosity might be aroused,
so that he would fall into the way of watching
how often you did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; muttered the disturbed
Hiram uneasily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then the idea would become a conviction
that you must be carrying something very
valuable in that inner pocket. You see, if the
parties chanced to be crooked, that would make
them figure how they could get hold of your
property. So the very movement which you
meant to be a safeguard would prove your undoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob, I&rsquo;ll try and quit that, if you think it
best,&rdquo; promised the other, apparently more or
less impressed with the logic the scout leader had
brought to bear on the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, Hiram, but I&rsquo;m afraid
your repentance comes too late to do much
good,&rdquo; Rob told him, at which the inventor gave
a start, and into his eyes there crept a look of
concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever can you mean by saying that,
Rob?&rdquo; he asked in a troubled voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Rob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that
you&rsquo;ve already attracted the attention you wanted
to avoid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! here on this train, in this sleeper?&rdquo;
whispered Hiram, appalled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look up now, when I mention the matter,
because they might see you, for I expect
they&rsquo;re watching us. Both of you have undoubtedly
noticed two men who sit back of you, and
at the end of the car, one of them small and
stout, the other tall and slim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Andy admitted, &ldquo;the tall one nodded
when he passed, and acted like he wanted to
open up a talk with me, but I turned to the window
again as if I was too much taken up with
the scenery here to bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the stout one nodded to me when he
caught my eye,&rdquo; said Hiram. &ldquo;&rsquo;Course I nodded
back, but made out not to look that way again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve been holding considerable conversation
in low tones,&rdquo; explained Rob. &ldquo;I
could manage to glimpse them in the glass at our
end of the car, though they didn&rsquo;t suspect me
of spying. Every time either of you thought
to get up, or even turn your heads they made
out to be half asleep, with their eyes shut; but
I could see they were talking about you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then mebbe that Marsters did send emissaries
along with me to try and steal the product
of my brains!&rdquo; complained Hiram, with compressed
lips and stern demeanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that doesn&rsquo;t follow at all,&rdquo; Rob assured
him. &ldquo;These fellows may just happen to be a
pair of hard cases always on the lookout for
signs of a paying haul. When they noticed how
you kept feeling of your inside pocket they
guessed from the signs you must have something
worth while hidden away there. Men who
make their living from the world by sharp tricks
get to read character wonderfully well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Andy put in just then, &ldquo;they say that
old and experienced customs inspectors can tell
from a person&rsquo;s looks in nine cases out of ten
whether he or she is trying to smuggle things
into the country without declaring them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do about it then, Rob?&rdquo; asked
Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan that would fill the bill,&rdquo; he
was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on and tell me, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You come with me into the car ahead. We&rsquo;ll
sit in the smoking compartment for a few minutes
if it happens to be empty. There you can
give me your packet, and I&rsquo;ll fasten it inside my
coat, handing over some worthless papers for
you to do up as if they were priceless in value,
to pin in your pocket instead. Do you get what
I&rsquo;m telling you, Hiram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob, count me in,&rdquo; the other replied hastily.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing, for even if they did happen
to rob me they&rsquo;d be having their pains for nothing.
When you&rsquo;re ready, give me the tip and
I&rsquo;ll follow after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy,&rdquo; Rob continued impressively, &ldquo;as we
pass out you change your seat so that you&rsquo;re
facing the two men. In that way you can seem
to be watching, and they&rsquo;re not so apt to follow
after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; muttered Andy; &ldquo;any time you see
fit I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob first of all made a little packet with some
old letters taken from his pocket, and which he
had been thinking of discarding for some time.
This he could do without exposing his hands
above the shelter afforded by the back of the
seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All ready, Hiram; get up, and seem to be
coaxing me to go with you. Finally, lay hold of
my sleeve and pull me. I&rsquo;ll act as if I didn&rsquo;t
much care to accompany you. That will serve
to divert attention; and as you pass the men
turn your eyes the other way. If you can be
saying something about some one being glad to
see me, it would make them believe we knew a
passenger in one of the forward cars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How Rob did look to the small details of
everything he undertook! He knew from past
experiences that after all these are what bring
success in the long run.</p>
<p>Although Rob had told Hiram to turn his
head the other way while nearing the two suspicious
men, he himself gave them a nod in
passing, just the salutation one traveler is apt to
bestow upon another when they have been fellow
passengers in the same car for hours, perhaps
days.</p>
<p>Rob did that purposely; he knew it would
serve to allay any suspicion that may have been
bred in the minds of the men to the effect that
their actions had been observed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Once in the car ahead, they found that for a
wonder the smoking compartment happened to
be empty. Taking advantage of this chance, Hiram
hurriedly unpinned the packet he had guarded
so closely, and gave it into the possession
of his chum. In its stead he secured the dummy
in his pocket.</p>
<p>All this had consumed hardly two minutes of
time. Rob was careful to notice that not a single
soul had passed the door of the compartment;
and as soon as the exchange had been effected he
stepped out in order to take a survey of the
car, to find that neither of the two suspicious
men had actually followed them from the other
sleeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That job&rsquo;s finished, and I feel a whole lot
easier in my mind,&rdquo; admitted Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter whether I was right or not, there&rsquo;s
no harm been done,&rdquo; Rob told him; &ldquo;and now,
Hiram, see that every five minutes or so you
keep on feeling your coat as you were doing it
before. I&rsquo;m more than curious to know whether
they&rsquo;ll try it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; chuckled the other, as if amused, &ldquo;if
they don&rsquo;t it isn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be for want of chances,
I tell you that, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back to our places,&rdquo; the scout leader
added, &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t feel altogether safe
away from my suitcase, with all that wonderful
stuff in it the professor said represented so much
research and effort that made it priceless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men were there as they had left them.
Rob again nodded carelessly when he found that
the short man was eagerly watching to catch his
eyes; but he did not stop to enter into any conversation
when the other made some casual remark,
only replying over his shoulder as he
passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They kept talking like a blue streak while
you were gone,&rdquo; said Andy, after the other two
had seated themselves. &ldquo;Twice the tall man
stepped off as if he meant to follow you, but
he must have thought better of it, for he turned
back before getting out of the car, and shook
his head at the other one. They are up to something
evil, Rob, take my word for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We only have one more meal aboard the
train, and then comes the hotel at Los Angeles,&rdquo;
said Hiram. &ldquo;I guess we can hold &rsquo;em off that
much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how you can overdo things by being
too much on your guard, Hiram,&rdquo; Rob explained.
&ldquo;Only for the way you kept on feeling your
pocket they would never have suspected that Boy
Scouts traveling alone could own anything worth
stealing. The best way to do is to make things
secure, and then appear to forget all about
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will at another time, Rob; but between the
way that Marsters acted, and the caution these
people on the Coast impressed on me, it all got
on my nerves. You see, I thought it was only
business to tell the Golden Gate people how
Eastern concerns had men buzzing me continually
to sell to them. That made them warn
me not to take anyone into my confidence while
traveling. They know some unscrupulous firms
would steal an idea as big as my invention, if
they could get away with it. But it&rsquo;s all right
now, and they can whistle for their prize for all
I care.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">A SHOCK AT LOS ANGELES.</span></h2>
<p>The time passed, and when one of the waiters
passed through to announce supper, the boys had
laid out their program. As before, Rob and Hiram
were to go first, while Andy held the fort
for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember and don&rsquo;t leave the seat under any
condition while we&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; was what the scout
leader told Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suspect that they might even try to
get away with our hand baggage?&rdquo; asked the
other. &ldquo;I thought it was only Hiram&rsquo;s pockets
they wanted to explore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are thieves nothing is safe from
them,&rdquo; explained Rob. &ldquo;&lsquo;An ounce of prevention
is better than a pound of cure.&rsquo; Keep your
foot on my bag as you sit here. If anybody tries
to tempt you to change seats just say you&rsquo;ve got
a bone in your leg, and don&rsquo;t care to move around
more than you can help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; chuckled Andy; &ldquo;it hurts terribly,
too; and the only thing that is able to make
me use it is the walk to the dinner&mdash;the cake-walk
I call it. Leave it all to me, Rob; I&rsquo;m
frozen to this seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, the pair passed along the aisle
and headed for the dining-car. Again the two
men did their best to be civil, even nodding and
smiling genially as the two boys passed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob, they&rsquo;re chasing after us!&rdquo; muttered Hiram,
in some little anxiety, just as he and his
chum had entered the next car and were passing
along the narrow corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, there&rsquo;s no law to prevent them
from getting hungry at the same time we do,&rdquo;
replied Rob over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may choose to sit down with us at
the same table, and make themselves chummy,&rdquo;
objected the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not if we know it,&rdquo; Rob told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we help it without making some
sort of scene?&rdquo; asked Hiram.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy enough, if we can pick a table
that only accommodates two,&rdquo; explained the
scout leader, &ldquo;and as we&rsquo;re in the advance, we
have our choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently, Hiram was considerably relieved
by what his comrade had said. He once more
realized that Rob promised to be equal to the
occasion. Indeed, the record of past achievements
should have told Hiram this long ago; but
in the presence of new dangers he was apt to
forget what splendid things Rob had accomplished
on other occasions when the tide seemed
adverse.</p>
<p>Upon entering the dining-car Rob smiled to
see that there was just one table seating two
that did not have some one at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our chance, Rob, down at the further
end of the car!&rdquo; said Hiram hastily, as
though he feared the other might not see the
table.</p>
<p>Rob took the chair that placed his back against
the partition. This allowed him to survey the
rest of the car. Nothing could have suited his
plans better, for there was a small mirror that
he could use to spy upon the two men who were
now sitting facing him, halfway up the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>As the meal progressed and evening drew on,
the electric lights in the diner were turned on.
Hiram somehow seemed to lack his voracious appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just know what&rsquo;s the cause, Rob,&rdquo; he
remarked, when the other accused him of not
disposing of much of the food he had ordered,
&ldquo;it may be the rocking of the car, which is
fierce just now; or else it comes of my riding
backward. I&rsquo;ve been told that some people never
can stand for that. But I guess I won&rsquo;t starve
to death between now and morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men talked a good deal, but then
there was nothing suspicious in that. Rob also
noticed that they watched him and companion
from time to time, as if their interest kept on
growing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>When Hiram happened to think of his instructions,
and occasionally raised a hand to feel for
his coat in the region of that inner pocket, Rob
kept a close watch on the men. He could plainly
see the shorter one nudge his companion in the
side, and say something, for his lips moved. Undoubtedly
he was calling the other&rsquo;s attention
to Hiram&rsquo;s suggestive movement, and while not
a lip-reader, Rob could easily imagine him saying
half under his breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, there he goes at it again! Just as we
decided, he must have something rich hidden
away there. And we&rsquo;re fools if we don&rsquo;t make
a big bid for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob was by this time fully satisfied that the
men had evil designs on his comrade&rsquo;s inside
pocket. He was determined to be unusually
careful about riding in a public conveyance while
in Los Angeles, since that would give the rascals
a chance to accomplish their purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re satisfied, Hiram, let&rsquo;s be getting
out of here,&rdquo; said Rob, who had seen the two
men getting an extra portion of food, believing
that this might be a good chance to leave them
in the lurch, since they would hardly jump up
and accompany the boys, for fear of attracting
attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>The two scouts quickly arose, seized their
hats, and passed along between the tables, which
were pretty generally occupied by that time. Rob
took occasion to keep his eyes on the two men,
for several reasons. He even returned their
nods as though no such thing as a suspicion regarding
their honesty had come into his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They missed that chance, anyhow!&rdquo; Hiram
remarked, as with some difficulty they threaded
their way through the next car, for the train
was making fast time, and things rolled more or
less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to keep on the alert all the time
if we expect to leave those smart chaps in the
lurch,&rdquo; Rob told him. &ldquo;You know the old saying,
&lsquo;eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,&rsquo;
and it applies to us right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve given up all
hope yet, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That kind of men never do until they&rsquo;ve
exhausted every plan,&rdquo; the scout leader replied.
&ldquo;I expect that right now they&rsquo;ve got some scheme
in mind they mean to spring on us if they get but
half a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Reaching their section in the sleeper, they sent
Andy ahead to get his supper. He told them he
was as hungry as a wolf, and would make up
for what Hiram failed to dispose of, so that the
company should not get too rich off what they
paid into its coffers.</p>
<p>After a while the men came in and took their
seats. Rob was a little afraid one of them might
be bold enough to push himself upon them. He
had prepared for this during their absence by
having Hiram sit alongside of him next the window,
while the other seat was piled high with
some of their luggage, thus offering no chance
for a third party to find room.</p>
<p>But it proved a false alarm. Neither of the
men made any advance whatever, and Rob believed
they had figured that action on their part
while on the train might get them into trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time will come when we are in the station
at Los Angeles,&rdquo; he told Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; asked the other
curiously; and it might be noticed that he did
not seem to be trembling any longer; for since
his packet was safe in the possession of Rob
Blake, Hiram did not see any necessity for further
worrying over the matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must be careful every minute of the time
until we reach the hotel,&rdquo; the scout leader explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! do you know, Rob, what I&rsquo;ve got a
good notion to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be reckless, perhaps,&rdquo; chuckled the other,
guessing this, perhaps, from the little boastful
strain he detected in the language Hiram used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to be frank with you, Rob, I really
feel sorry for those chumps. They&rsquo;ve taken a
whole lot of interest in a poor country chap like
me, and it seems a shame they should be bitterly
disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s the way things set, do they?&rdquo; continued
Rob. &ldquo;You feel so bad on their account
that you&rsquo;re tempted to give them a chance to
steal that dummy packet you have fastened inside
your pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone so far as to take the pin out, you
see,&rdquo; chuckled Hiram. &ldquo;If they do get busy
they needn&rsquo;t have the worry of that to keep
them back. And when you look at it in the right
light, Rob, wouldn&rsquo;t that be just the quickest way
to get rid of the slick rascals?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the chances are that if they did manage
to lay hands on your packet, they&rsquo;d disappear
in a big hurry, Hiram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. Let them make the opportunity,
and I&rsquo;ll try to be as accommodating as
possible. You know, Rob, that I&rsquo;m said to be
an easy mark among the boys of Hampton. I
hate to disappoint anybody in the worst way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Andy, and he looks as if he has
enjoyed his supper first-rate, too,&rdquo; Rob remarked.
&ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t let them get him into conversation
for an entering wedge. I forgot to warn
him about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Andy was wise enough on his own
account to know the folly of such a move, as he
pushed past the two men, paying no attention
even when one of them plucked at his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more hour and we&rsquo;ll be there, the conductor
told me,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must be about on time, according
to the schedule,&rdquo; said Hiram, who had worn his
time-table almost to shreds by consulting it so
often on the long journey from New York City.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>They proceeded to get all their belongings in
shape, so there would be nothing to delay them,
once the station was reached. Rob had decided
to take a carriage to the Hotel Alexandria, and
thus avoid all possible contact with strangers.</p>
<p>When the porter announced that they were entering
Los Angeles there was considerable confusion,
as passengers caught up such of their
hand luggage as had not been already piled near
the door by the porter.</p>
<p>Rob had resolutely declined to let the negro
touch his suitcase, though his liberal tip to the
man made him eager to be of some assistance.
The boy knew that at this point there was apt to
crop up a crisis; and also that the good record
held up to that time might be shattered through
any carelessness on his part.</p>
<p>Consequently, he held fast to his grip as he
followed Hiram out of the car, this mode of procedure
having all been settled upon beforehand.
It gave Rob a chance to keep his eagle eye on the
figure of Hiram; and so long as he was able to
do that he did not believe the other could be spirited
away, or his pocket picked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for getting in a crush, Hiram,&rdquo; Rob
whispered in the other&rsquo;s ear as they passed along
the narrow corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went out ahead of us, Rob,&rdquo; Hiram informed
him, as he turned his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that, but we&rsquo;re going to run up
against those men again before we are out of
this scrape,&rdquo; the scout leader prophesied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m awful glad we&rsquo;re in at last. That
was a long trip, and I&rsquo;m tired of the old car,&rdquo;
said the one in the lead. &ldquo;Thank goodness we&rsquo;ll
soon be landed in San Francisco, where my business
can be settled, one way or the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see them, Rob!&rdquo; announced Andy, just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they&rsquo;re waiting for us, just as I
thought,&rdquo; ventured Rob. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll push straight
on to where we can get a carriage, and then leave
them in the lurch. Above all, nobody must stop
to talk; keep walking, and stick together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s understood, Rob!&rdquo; came from Hiram;
while Andy in the rear gave a grunt as if to signify
that he had it all fixed in his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>There was a lively scene as friends rushed this
way and that to find those for whom they were
waiting; and as the three scouts walked steadily
along in line, headed for the exit where the carriages
were to be found, the two men suddenly
appeared alongside them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to bother you young fellows,&rdquo; said the
tall man, in a low but commanding voice, &ldquo;but we
are United States marshals, and you must consider
yourselves bound to come with us, for you
are under arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">TURNING THE TABLES ON TWO ROGUES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Arrested! Oh! my stars!&rdquo; ejaculated Hiram,
falling to trembling when he felt the hand of
the tall stranger drop heavily upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! this is a warm reception to California
for a fact!&rdquo; burst out Andy, in considerable
consternation, as he dropped his bundles, and
stood there staring at the two mysterious men.</p>
<p>Rob, too, was somewhat staggered at the abrupt
accusation, though he quickly rallied his
senses, and found his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your warrant for doing this?&rdquo; he
demanded of the shorter man, who immediately
flipped back his coat to disclose some sort of
nickel badge pinned to his vest, not giving Rob
enough time to make it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need any warrant, being in the service
of the Government,&rdquo; this worthy assured
him in as gruff a tone as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But who do you take us for, and what are
we accused of doing?&rdquo; asked Rob, continuing to
keep a firm grip on his suitcase through it all,
though he allowed his eyes to rove around in
search of a policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that, my boy; you will find
it all out after we have arraigned you before the
United States Commissioner. We&rsquo;ve been
watching your party for some time, and believe
we&rsquo;ve bagged the right birds. Now, for your
sake, we don&rsquo;t want to make a scene, so we&rsquo;ll
just lock arms with you, and pass out of the
station that way to take a vehicle. If you know
what&rsquo;s good for you, pay no attention to any
one; and if you attempt to escape, remember,
we&rsquo;re prepared to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall man at that eagerly thrust a hand
through the left arm of Hiram, who made no resistance.
Rob, even in that exciting moment,
noticed that he had managed to get on the side
nearest the pocket where the inventor had placed
his valuable papers, now snugly reposing on
Rob&rsquo;s person. It was very significant, to say
the least; and Rob began immediately to discover
what Hiram would have called &ldquo;the nigger
in the woodpile.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then, boys,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in
for it, and there&rsquo;s no need of kicking up any disturbance.
We&rsquo;ll go before the Commissioner
and prove our innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right sensible of you, young fellow!&rdquo;
declared the shorter man, as he took hold of
Rob&rsquo;s arm and escorted him along.</p>
<p>Other people were pushing past, but were so
busy with their own affairs that they did not
seem to pay any attention to the little drama being
enacted on the station platform.</p>
<p>A minute later and Rob believed the time had
come to act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that way, son; we&rsquo;re meaning to take a
carriage over here,&rdquo; said the tall man, designating
the opposite direction to that in which Rob
had turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please yourselves, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Rob, suddenly
displaying quite a different manner.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided that <i>we</i> want to go out this way;
and that policeman standing there has his eye
on us this very minute. I think I had better call
him over and ask him to get you to show your
colors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; said Andy, recklessly, all
the pent-up indignation that had been boiling
within him breaking loose.</p>
<p>Had a bomb fallen near them, the two men
could not have shown more concern. They must
have realized that their shrewd little game had
been called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ve made a mistake about this business,
McGuire!&rdquo; said the short man, hastily looking
around him as though desirous of discovering
a good opening for flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems that way to me, Colonel; and we&rsquo;ll
say good-by to you, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;ve gone!&rdquo; cried Andy, as though
he could hardly believe his eyes.</p>
<p>Rob had really been on the point of summoning
the officer standing there; but since the rascals
had chosen to run and mingle with the out-pouring
crowd, and Rob did not wish to have
attention called to himself and chums, he wisely
held his tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Hiram was laughing to himself as though it
struck him in the light of a good joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Hiram?&rdquo; asked Andy, not
yet able to grasp the situation sufficiently to see
the humorous side of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only wondering what they&rsquo;ll say when
they come to find out how they&rsquo;ve been so badly
sold, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; replied the inventor, again indulging
in one of his laughing fits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they get it?&rdquo; demanded Rob, instantly,
guessing that there was a reason for all this
hilarity on the part of the other chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he slicked it out of my pocket the cutest
way you ever saw,&rdquo; replied Hiram. &ldquo;I felt his
hand going in, so I held my breath to give him
all the chance I could; and he did it, too, sure
he did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got the papers, you mean, don&rsquo;t you, Hiram?&rdquo;
asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dummy you made up for me, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then both the others had occasion to smile
broadly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they&rsquo;ll enjoy reading those letters the
boys wrote me while we were over in Europe
last fall,&rdquo; Rob remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a heap to see them when they find
what a wonderful windfall they&rsquo;ve struck to pay
them for all their trouble,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get a conveyance and start for the
Alexandria without any more delay,&rdquo; advised
the scout leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me for a comfy bed to-night,&rdquo; Hiram
laughed; &ldquo;better get a room with plenty of space
for all of us, Rob. After this excitement to
greet us on reaching California, I think it would
be as well to stick together till we&rsquo;ve unloaded
our cargo, and have our time to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were soon at the hotel. They were taken
up to the fifth floor, on which were three connecting
rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High enough up so we needn&rsquo;t be afraid of
any one climbing in at the window,&rdquo; Hiram remarked,
after he had first of all taken in the
view, with the late moon just peeping above the
mountains in the east.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no danger of those two fellows chasing
after us any longer,&rdquo; laughed Andy. &ldquo;They got
their fill of it, and will pick out somebody besides
scouts for their next victims. Who got
bit, I want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As everybody laughed and seemed satisfied,
it could be set down as positive that the three
scouts were not feeling badly over the adventure
that had marked their introduction to the
Coast.</p>
<p>The night passed without any incident worthy
of recording. Hiram declared that he never
knew a single thing after his head touched the
pillow; he was so much in need of a good night&rsquo;s
sleep that he must have dropped off instantly,
to be finally aroused by hearing Rob announce
it was time for breakfast.</p>
<p>They determined to put their valuables in the
hotel safe, and spend several days in and around
Los Angeles, though they would not have time
to run down to San Diego and visit the other
big exposition which was in full blast there.</p>
<p>This they did, and enjoyed every minute of
the time, though they were never long in one
place, so many things did they have to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>It being Hiram&rsquo;s first chance to look upon
tropical vegetation, he was highly delighted with
what he saw in the streets and public gardens
of the bustling city.</p>
<p>Then they went out to visit an orange grove,
and besides that, inspected numerous enterprises
connected with the great fruit-growing belt
around Riverside. This place the boys were
ready to declare&mdash;with its groves covering the
broad valley, and with the mountains, their tops
snow-covered, looming up beyond&mdash;to be the
most delightful town on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>But the boys came to the conclusion that while
all these things were truly wonderful and especially
delightful, they had not come out to the
coast on a pleasure jaunt; and hence no further
time should be spent in this way until they had
accomplished the several duties that awaited
their attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made arrangements for seats in the parlor-car
with the train leaving to-morrow morning,&rdquo;
Rob announced on the second evening, as
they discussed supper and the many things they
had seen since early morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When will we get to San Francisco then?&rdquo;
asked Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After dark,&rdquo; Rob informed him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more
than three hundred miles away, you know, for
California is a big State, especially from north
to south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to that, then, Rob,&rdquo; continued the
other, &ldquo;on the day after to-morrow we ought to
be taking in some of the sights of the World&rsquo;s
Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our programme,&rdquo; admitted the leader
and guide of the expedition, as he threw down
his napkin, and pushed his chair away, in which
he was copied a little reluctantly, perhaps, by
both his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for not asking if you were
through, Hiram,&rdquo; said Rob in an aside, &ldquo;but honestly
I was afraid Andy would founder if he
ate any more. He&rsquo;s developed such an enormous
appetite since landing here, there&rsquo;s liable to be
an explosion unless we watch him pretty close.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll eat up all your spare cash, that&rsquo;s the
worst of it,&rdquo; complained Hiram, who was a little
inclined to be close with his money as a rule;
possibly because he had found a pressing need
for every dollar in conducting his numerous experiments,
for it costs more or less to &ldquo;potter&rdquo;
with schemes along the line of invention.</p>
<p>Rob only laughed, and it was very evident that
this contingency did not worry him to any great
extent. He knew there were ample funds at
hand for all ordinary expenses, with more coming
if needed.</p>
<p>They were off on the morning train, and all
through that day enjoyed the scenery that was
spread out before them&mdash;through Santa Barbara
and on up until it reached San Francisco.</p>
<p>That day&rsquo;s journey would never be forgotten
by any of the three scouts. They stored a thousand
incidents away in their memories for future
enjoyment.</p>
<p>As evening came on they knew they must be
getting in the vicinity of the great city that had
recovered from the horrors of the earthquake
and destruction by fire with such marvelous speed
as to awaken the admiration of the whole world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can see the light in the sky whenever
the train makes a turn,&rdquo; remarked Andy to Hiram
who, as usual, had his nose glued against
the glass.</p>
<p>Taking a carriage after they had left the train
they soon found themselves installed at the Fairmont
Hotel, which Rob had been told to patronize
by Judge Collins, because of its fine view of
San Francisco Bay, and the Golden Gate, as well
as possibly the glimpses to be obtained of the
illuminated towers in the Exposition grounds
along the shore.</p>
<p>It was after nine when they arrived, and of
course the boys were not foolish enough to think
of attempting anything until they had slept, and
felt reinvigorated.</p>
<p>Looking from the windows of the large room
they had taken, with two double beds in it, they
went into raptures over the scene. The moon,
though due before long, had not yet risen, and
it seemed as though a million lights dazzled their
eyes in every direction, and made it look like a
scene from fairyland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>And so, in due time, they sought their beds,
and slept so close to the Great Exposition that it
would seem as though the whirr of innumerable
wheels in Machinery Hall, or the murmur of the
multitude of visitors roaming about the extensive
grounds, must of necessity be borne aloft to the
ears of the three eager lads who had come thousands
of miles to view the wonders of the display.</p>
<p>But, at any rate, they managed to put in a restful
night, and when morning routed them from
their beds, they were in fine fettle to begin the
first day&rsquo;s sight-seeing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">WITHIN THE GATES OF THE FAIR.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What about those papers of mine, Rob?
Had I better take charge of the same now, or
let you continue to keep them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram asked this question as they arose after
finishing their breakfast, and found themselves
facing the business of the first day at the Exposition.
The whole city, as far as they could see,
was in gala attire. Bunting and flags were everywhere
visible; and it was evident that the good
people of San Francisco, in spite of many great
discouragements, such as the breaking out of the
World War abroad, and the failure of the canal
to stay dug on account of the slides, were doing
all in their power to make the fair a huge success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you leave it with me to decide, Hiram,&rdquo; the
scout leader remarked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say no to both your
propositions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be done with them, then?&rdquo; cried
Hiram, as though puzzled by what the other had
just said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means to duplicate our plan down at Los
Angeles,&rdquo; spoke up wideawake Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! put them in the hotel safe till they&rsquo;re
wanted, is that the idea, Rob?&rdquo; demanded the
owner of the said packet that had been giving
them all manner of trouble since the time they
left San Antonio in Texas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems the best scheme, according to
my mind,&rdquo; Hiram was told by the one in whom
he felt such abiding faith. &ldquo;Then, no matter
what you find out about those people you&rsquo;ve come
to see, the papers needn&rsquo;t worry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right about that, Rob, and it&rsquo;s
a go. Just as like as not I would be doing some
fool play, and mebbe losing the precious documents
that are to prove my case with the Golden
Gate folks. I&rsquo;ll go to the desk with you any
time you&rsquo;re ready, and see that the clerk gets
my property snugged away in his safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>When this had been done they set out. Rob,
of course, had his suitcase along with him. He
had taken out what few things of his own it
contained, and now it held only the precious
documents and other small exhibits that Professor
McEwen had been carrying in person to his
scientific colleagues at the Exposition, where they
were to be placed with other articles.</p>
<p>What those numerous small rolls and packages
contained none of the scouts really knew.
From some remarks, let fall by Judge Collins,
Rob had an idea they might be papyrus records
found in some old ancient tomb or pyramid, and
said to have come down from thousands of years
back. To the boys these would not have been
worth their bulk in sandwiches, possibly, because
they could not appreciate their intrinsic value;
but in the eyes of such men as the Scotch professor
they represented treasures beyond any
computation, far too valuable to be intrusted to
a common express company that might lose them,
or deliver them in a crushed condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tower I can see; it must be the one
that from our window last night seemed as if
a million fireflies had lighted on it,&rdquo; announced
Andy, with more or less excitement as they found
themselves close to one of the gates where entrance
to the Exposition grounds could be had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that must be the Tower of Jewels,&rdquo; said
Rob, &ldquo;and I should call it pretty well named in
the bargain. They&rsquo;ve certainly chosen a splendid
spot for the Fair, fronting, as it does, on the bay,
with its wide sweep of water, and with the city
rising up on tiers of terraces back of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the Zone over there,&rdquo; Andy continued,
eagerly; &ldquo;because you can see a monster
seesaw, with one arm away up hundreds of feet
in the air, and what looks like a car on it full of
folks. Yes, I remember it now; it is called the
A&euml;roscope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it is, Andy,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;and when
we get up there for a look over the harbor, the
Exposition grounds and the city, we&rsquo;ll find ourselves
just three hundred and twenty-five feet
off the earth&mdash;high enough to make you dizzy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! seems like they do things on a big scale
out this way,&rdquo; grunted Hiram.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon our Coney Island would hardly be
in the swim with this show,&rdquo; Andy declared, as
they paid their way at the gate and entered the
grounds.</p>
<p>Colossal buildings could be seen on all sides,
most of them dazzling in the sunlight. Rob had
studied the arrangement of these buildings so
well that he appeared to recognize them now as
though entirely familiar with his surroundings.
It was evident that the little party would not
have much use for a guide as long as Rob was
along to serve them in that capacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I calculate that this is the Panama-Pacific
Court of the Universe,&rdquo; he told his chums, &ldquo;and
that building over there is the Palace of Agriculture,
while this other must be the Palace of
Transportation; then there&rsquo;s the Palace of Horticulture
where you can see that huge glass dome.
Over there is the Column of Progress, more than
a hundred and fifty feet high, and overlooking
the Marino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys surveyed these sights with more or
less awe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; ventured Hiram, &ldquo;after we&rsquo;ve
nosed around here for a week or two we&rsquo;ll feel
as much to hum with these big buildings as if
we were in Hampton, and lookin&rsquo; at our Odd
Fellows&rsquo; Temple. But what a heap of things
they must all of &rsquo;em hold. It&rsquo;ll keep us hustlin&rsquo;
to see the hull lot, workin&rsquo; ten hours a day for
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, none of us expect to see everything
that&rsquo;s on exhibit here,&rdquo; said Rob. &ldquo;Our tastes
are not wholly alike, either. I may want to spend
most of my time in a certain quarter that
wouldn&rsquo;t interest you other fellows to any great
extent; and on your part I&rsquo;ve no doubt there are
certain things that will hold you spellbound, yet
which we may only care to take one good look
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Andy started to chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warrant you I can guess where Hiram will
be found pretty much all his time at the show,&rdquo;
he remarked, pointedly; and of course the other
scout felt impelled to take him up on that positive
assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say where, then, if you know so much, Mr.
Smarty,&rdquo; he asked Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as he gets the locations down
pat,&rdquo; began the other, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never see him a
great way off from the quarter where the inventions
are being exhibited. He&rsquo;s daffy on mechanics
and such things; and he&rsquo;ll be worse than
any sticking plaster you ever saw, once he gets
planted in front of the booths, or finds out where
the a&euml;roplanes are going up every little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, I own up that&rsquo;s mostly what I
wanted to come all the way out here for,&rdquo; said
Hiram, frankly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a toss-up, Andy, that
once you get in that amusement park they call
the Zone, a place of more&rsquo;n sixty acres, I read,
you&rsquo;ll spend most of your time watching the Fiji
Islanders dance, or riding around on that observation
car to view the wonders of Yellowstone
Park, or mebbe the Great Colorado Canyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get there any too soon, I&rsquo;m telling you,
boys,&rdquo; Andy confessed. &ldquo;Both of you have come
out here on business as well as sight-seeing; but
it&rsquo;s different in my case. I&rsquo;m carefree, and bound
to enjoy myself to the limit. In good time I&rsquo;ll
wander all over every building in the grounds;
but first I want to be amused so as to forget the
troubles of our long trip here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very evident,&rdquo; began Rob, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ll have
to settle on some particular place as a sort of
general round-up. If each one is going to start
off on his own hook, now and then, unless we fix
it that way, we might wander all day long
through the enormous buildings, and the grounds
covered by this Fair, and never meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well thought of, Rob!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Let me
suggest that we take this queer-looking tobacconist
shop as our rendezvous. We can make an
arrangement with the owner for a couple of dollars
or so, to take messages, and hold the same
for the rest of the bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner that&rsquo;s arranged the better it&rsquo;ll suit
me, I guess,&rdquo; said Hiram, who was plainly on
needles and pins while being kept from hunting
up the building in which he would find myriads of
remarkable devices illustrating the inventive genius
of the world, and particularly of those from
the American nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m going at once to the exhibit in
which Professor McEwen is interested,&rdquo; said
Rob, after they had arranged with the proprietor
of the Oriental tobacco booth, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;ll not
feel easy until I&rsquo;ve done my part of the contract,
and delivered the stuff he intrusted to our
charge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, that means me too, I suppose, Rob,&rdquo; observed
Andy, sighing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I could do it alone,&rdquo; Rob started to say,
when Andy braced up, bit his lip, and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the old selfish streak in me speaking
then, Rob. You&rsquo;ll have to overlook it once
more. Of course, I&rsquo;ll not let you finish this business
by yourself. It would be a fine way of acting
on my part, now, wouldn&rsquo;t it&mdash;taking the
goods and then refusing to pay for the same?
Here, let me carry the bag a while. I&rsquo;m going to
be your shadow for this one day anyhow; though
p&rsquo;raps, after all, we can manage to drop in at
the Zone, and see what&rsquo;s what in that interesting
district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a special point of it to oblige you,
Andy,&rdquo; he said, clapping the other on the shoulder.
&ldquo;As for Hiram, I can understand why he&rsquo;s
so anxious to find out where the aviation field
lies. We&rsquo;ve got to remember that his business is
with parties who are altogether interested in airships
and flying.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Rob,&rdquo; said Hiram, nodding his head
in that quick jerky way he had. &ldquo;It stands to
reason that I want to pick up a few pointers on
the sly before I show myself to the Golden Gate
people. By hanging around I&rsquo;m apt to hear some
talk, and learn a few facts that may stand me in
good later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go some slow, Hiram,&rdquo; cautioned
Andy. &ldquo;Remember that we had it arranged
to back you up when the time came to
interview your people. So don&rsquo;t spoil all our
plans by being too precipitate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning, I figure,&rdquo; Hiram answered, wincing
under that last word, &ldquo;that I mustn&rsquo;t be rash, and
put my foot in it. I promise you I&rsquo;ll fight shy
there, Rob; and when we meet here to get a
bite of lunch together, p&rsquo;raps I&rsquo;ll have some news
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it will be the right kind of news, then,
Hiram,&rdquo; Rob told him, seriously; &ldquo;though for
that matter it seems to me this company has
treated you splendidly already, and that they
must be on the square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that affair is all settled up,&rdquo; continued
the other, drawing a long breath of anticipation,
&ldquo;think of the great times I&rsquo;m going to
have mousing around the building that houses
the inventions. I tell you I&rsquo;m the luckiest dog
that ever lived to get this big chance thrown right
at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Hiram hurried away, having already
marked out his course from long study of the
little chart each one of the scouts possessed, and
which gave what might be called a &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye
view&rdquo; of the extensive Exposition grounds, where
the most prominent buildings were located, and
the shortest way to get from one point to another.</p>
<p>Rob looked after him with a smile on his face.
He turned to Andy and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the greatest crank in his line you
ever saw?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s hardly fair to call Hiram that,&rdquo; expostulated
the scout leader; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s enthusiastic
over inventions, but what of that? Every fellow
who&rsquo;s dead in earnest could be spoken of as
a crank. And it&rsquo;s the cranks, as you call them,
who make the wheels of progress go around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Andy dryly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that
some of them even seem to have wheels in their
heads, though they get hopping mad if you mention
it, or turn your hand this way,&rdquo; and he indicated
a revolving motion with his finger that
could hardly be mistaken by a sensitive person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know is that Hiram is due to enjoy the
greatest feast his soul ever could imagine. But
don&rsquo;t let us waste any more time here, Andy;
I&rsquo;ve got my bearings by now, and can take you
straight to the building where the scientists love
to gather and gloat over the queer things that
are so wonderful to them. Come along!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">ROB DELIVERS THE GOODS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that splendid looking arch over there
meant to represent, Rob?&rdquo; asked Andy, as he
pointed to the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call it the Arch of the Setting Sun,&rdquo;
replied the scout leader.</p>
<div class="img" id="p001">
<img src="images/p001.jpg" alt="&ldquo;They call it the Arch of the Setting Sun,&rdquo; replied the scout leader." width="500" height="720" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;They call it the Arch of the Setting Sun,&rdquo; replied the scout leader.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;A mighty good name, considering how we&rsquo;re
at the jumping-off place of the United States.
Seems to me, Rob, that the Far West has always
gone by the name of the Land of the Setting
Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the arch has been built,&rdquo; Rob told
him. &ldquo;You see, in pioneer days the constant drift
was always this way. Men who founded homes
in what was then the wilderness along the Ohio
kept hearing wonderful stories about the richness
of the soil farther west, and what unlimited
fur-bearing animals were to be captured by those
daring enough to take the risk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And so they kept pushing farther and farther,
year in and year out. In this way settlers
finally overran the prairies, and crossed the
Rockies?&rdquo; asked Andy, as he surveyed the beautiful
arch that had been raised to commemorate
the dreams of the men who blazed the way of
civilization through the wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and here along the shore of the Pacific
lay the end of the dream,&rdquo; explained the scout
leader. &ldquo;California represented the foot of the
rainbow of promise those hardy men had seen
painted in the sky. The western sun meant a
whole lot in those days; it shone over the Land
of Promise; it was the hope and ambition of
almost every settler. No one drifted East; it was
always into the mysterious and beckoning West
that families emigrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around them were crowds of eager sight-seers.
At times they jostled elbows with representatives
of numerous foreign nations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there are not near so many foreigners
visiting the Panama-Pacific Exposition as there
would have been only for the terrible European
war that&rsquo;s raging across the ocean,&rdquo; Rob happened
to remark a little later when the other scout
called his attention to a group of dark-featured
men wearing the red fezzes of Orientals, and
passing along as though viewing the wonders of
the exhibition with a lively interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the building erected by California
is reckoned the largest one of all on the grounds,
isn&rsquo;t it, Rob? How much space does it cover, do
you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say five acres, Andy, which you must
own is a shack of some size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been in it yet,&rdquo; said Andy, &ldquo;but
I should imagine it must hold about everything
connected with the life of the big State. Why, it
would take a whole day to get around there, and
see half of the things on exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of time for all that when we settle
down to the business of sight-seeing,&rdquo; Rob told
him. &ldquo;First of all I want to get this load off
my hands,&rdquo; and he moved the suitcase as he
spoke; &ldquo;not that it&rsquo;s very heavy, you understand,
only it weighs on my mind; but what it holds
means sleepless nights for our good friend, Professor
McEwen, until he gets my wire that it
has been safely delivered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I declare if those two girls over there don&rsquo;t
make me think of Lucy Mainwaring and Sue
Clifford away back in Hampton!&rdquo; exclaimed
Andy suddenly. &ldquo;Oh! excuse me, Rob, I didn&rsquo;t
mean to give you a start by mentioning Lucy&rsquo;s
name. Of course it&rsquo;s only a chance resemblance,
for neither of the girls we&rsquo;ve left behind us could
be here at the Exposition. But I&rsquo;m a great fellow,
you remember, to imagine people look like
some I&rsquo;ve known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and lots of times that failing has gotten
you into a peck of trouble, too, Andy,&rdquo; Rob remarked,
laughingly; &ldquo;there was that boy in scout
uniform this very morning that you rushed up
to with outstretched hand, and calling him Sim
Jeffords. I nearly took a fit to see the blank look
on your face when he drew himself up and gave
you the cold stare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a fact, Rob, he did freeze me.
Chances are to this minute that boy thinks I was
a fraud, perhaps some new sort of confidence
operator. I saw him grab at his watch-chain in
a hurry. He backed away, too, and never gave
me half a chance to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting right along,&rdquo; Rob told him, &ldquo;to
have you discover some of our old enemies hovering
around, and waiting for a chance to give
us a jolt on account of the grudge they bear us.
There&rsquo;s Jared Applegate, for instance, the last
we ever saw of him was at the time he was down
in Mexico, having been compelled to run away
from home after getting himself into a scrape by
using some money that didn&rsquo;t belong to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy, instead of appearing dejected while Rob
was &ldquo;rubbing it into him&rdquo; after this fashion,
really seemed to enter into the joke himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on to say with a snicker, &ldquo;honest
to goodness a little while ago I did see two
fellows walking along who made me think of
Max Ramsay and his pal, Hodge Berry, the two
meanest boys of our home town. Gave me something
of a thrill, too, and I even had a sneaking
notion to run over and shake hands with them;
though back home I would cross the street rather
than meet them face to face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s always the case with
people who&rsquo;re away from home. They get so
tired of seeing strange faces that the sight of
one they know makes them friendly. But I suppose
you&rsquo;ve noticed that the scouts seem to have
quite a share in the running of things at this
Big Show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a fact I&rsquo;ve seen quite a number of them
about, and it strikes me they are a busy lot in
the bargain,&rdquo; Andy admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand they have a permanent camp
on the grounds,&rdquo; Rob explained, &ldquo;which later on
we must visit, and make acquaintances. They
seem to be a hustling lot, and a credit to the khaki
they wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what d&rsquo;ye suppose they&rsquo;re doing here?&rdquo;
asked the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there are dozens of things Boy Scouts
can find to do at a monster Fair like this,&rdquo; said
the patrol leader. &ldquo;I think some of them are acting
as guides to parties of women and children.
Others run messages for the department heads,
because there must be a tremendous lot of that
sort of thing that has to be done here. I saw
one batch of scouts carrying a man on a litter,
and from that I concluded they must have a
scout emergency hospital somewhere on the
grounds, where those who have been taken suddenly
sick or become exhausted from the heat
in the machinery buildings could receive first aid
to the injured.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Andy&rsquo;s face took on a look of pride. He even
tenderly stroked the sleeve of his khaki coat and
touched the badge on his lapel as though he considered
it a great honor to be wearing that insignia
of his rank in the troop to which he belonged.</p>
<p>That is one of the finest things about scout
membership; it stimulates boys to aspire to emulate
those who are striving to help others, or
alleviate suffering in some way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be nearing that building you
spoke about, Rob,&rdquo; Andy remarked, after more
time had elapsed. &ldquo;Seems to me we&rsquo;ve covered
miles since we saw Hiram streaking off for the
aviation field and the Hall of Inventions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that is it on our left; but to make sure
I&rsquo;ll ask this scout hurrying along as though the
whole show would have to close its doors unless
he managed to do the important errand he&rsquo;s sent
on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang back while you do,&rdquo; suggested Andy
jokingly. &ldquo;Seems like they think I&rsquo;m a sort of
suspicious looking person, though nobody ever
told me so in Hampton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messenger condescended to slacken his
speed sufficiently to catch the question which Rob
asked. After saluting, as became a fellow scout,
he nodded his head in the affirmative, being apparently
too winded to say even a single word.</p>
<p>Accordingly the two boys entered the building
and threading their way among a multitude of
exhibits, with a sprinkling of people examining
the same, most of them rather sober-looking in
appearance, they managed to find where the offices
of the director were located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wish to see Professor Marsh, who is in
charge of this building,&rdquo; was what Rob said to
an active little man wearing large glasses, and
with all the earmarks of a scientist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That happens to be my name, son; what can
I do for you?&rdquo; replied the other, as he bent a
pair of exceedingly penetrating eyes upon the
scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have come to you,&rdquo; Rob explained, &ldquo;from
Professor Andrew McEwen, of Edinburgh University,
who met with an accident while visiting
an old friend near our home, on Long Island,
New York State, and while not seriously injured
could not finish his journey across the continent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man immediately showed signs of
tremendous excitement. He glued his eyes on
the suitcase Rob was carrying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, glad to hear that he is not seriously
injured. Professor McEwen is one of the most
famous of his class, and the world could ill afford
to lose him at this interesting stage of events.
But he was to bring with him a collection too
precious to trust to ordinary channels. I sincerely
trust that it was not harmed when he met
with his accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, hastily, &ldquo;not in
the least, since he did not have it with him at
the time. But he grieved to think it might be
delayed in reaching you, and so he intrusted it
to the keeping of myself and my comrade here,
as we happened to be of some assistance to him at
the time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>The scientist seemed to be actually dumfounded.
He stared from Rob to Andy, and then
looked hard at the suitcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be possible that Professor McEwen
intrusted those priceless papyrus relics to the
care of two mere boys? I am astounded, and
likewise worried. Oh! I hope you have taken
great care with them. Give me the bag, and let
me see for myself. It would be a shock indeed if
anything had happened to destroy the labor of
years, and caused such a dreadful loss to science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He almost snatched the suitcase from Rob&rsquo;s
hand and vanished like a streak through a door
that led to another room, leaving the two boys
exchanging amused glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! I&rsquo;m sorry for you if anything <i>has</i>
gone wrong with those rolls, Rob,&rdquo; said Andy,
making a wry face. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re apt to go out of
this building faster than we came in, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger,&rdquo; Rob told him; &ldquo;they were prepared
to resist ordinary shocks in transit, and
we&rsquo;ve handled them as carefully as Professor
McEwen himself could have done. But he did
look actually frightened, for a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer what a pile these learned scientists
think of things that other people wouldn&rsquo;t
give five cents for?&rdquo; remarked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re in
the dark concerning their real value. Look in
through the half-open door and you can see several
men like Professor Marsh undoing those
same rolls with trembling hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and notice the awed look on their faces,
will you, Rob? The director is shaking hands
all around now, and beaming on his colleagues,
so I guess he&rsquo;s found things O. K. and hunky
dory. Here he comes out to tell us so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look of deep anxiety on Professor Marsh&rsquo;s
face had vanished, and there was a trace of a
pleased smile there when he again confronted the
two scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The letter inclosed from Professor McEwen
speaks in the highest terms of you young gentlemen,&rdquo;
he said, effusively, as he stretched out
both hands. &ldquo;He writes that you were instruments
in the hands of Providence of saving his
life; and for that let me remark that you deserve
the heartfelt thanks of all who are interested in
the work that distinguished gentleman is doing
for science. I am proud to shake you by the
hand. To think that you have come three thousand
miles bearing those priceless rolls, and
delivered them to us here without the slightest
damage. And this very night I shall write to
Professor McEwen to that effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are instructed to wire him in your name
with your permission, professor, that you have
received them intact,&rdquo; ventured Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will sign any message you choose to send
him, son,&rdquo; declared the happy director of the
building devoted to the interests of science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, sir,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;would you mind
returning my suitcase?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">THE PEOPLE OF THE &ldquo;ZONE.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>When Rob and his chum left the building they
carried the empty suitcase; and besides, Professor
Marsh had written and signed a long and
effusive message to his learned colleague in care
of Judge Collins, at Hampton, Long Island, which
Rob was empowered to send, at his own expense,
by wire as a night letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That job is done,&rdquo; said Rob, with the air of
one who has gotten rid of a load that had been
on his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just to think how we can enjoy ourselves
for weeks if we feel like staying that long,&rdquo; pursued
the happy Andy, fairly bubbling over with
enthusiasm and joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even when we decide to start back home,&rdquo;
laughed Rob, &ldquo;the fun isn&rsquo;t over by a huge
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, Rob, we&rsquo;ll have the time of our
lives traveling across the Canadian Rockies, taking
in wonderful scenery that is better, lots of
people say, than anything across in Switzerland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the scout leader, &ldquo;and if we
choose to stop over for a day or two to try the
trout fishing at a lake we were told about,
haven&rsquo;t we got our rods and other material along
in our trunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes a wideawake fellow like you to think
of every little detail, for a fact!&rdquo; declared Andy,
with genuine admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m far from perfect, I want you to
know,&rdquo; the other told him. &ldquo;I can remember
plenty of times when I&rsquo;ve found that, after all, the
very thing of most importance was forgotten or
neglected. But it pays to try and cover the
ground. It saves lots of trouble and disappointment
in the long run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Rob; with me it seems as though
I fall into the way of letting some other fellow
do my thinking for me. I know it&rsquo;s wrong, but
anyhow it&rsquo;s satisfying to have that confidence in
your chum.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think of letting some other scout
do your work for you at the time you were learning
the various bugle calls, I noticed, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! that&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; returned the other,
hastily. &ldquo;Now that you mention it, I can&rsquo;t remember
ever asking a substitute to do my <i>eating</i>
for me when meal time rolled around. Guess you
must be right, though, Rob; some of these days I
intend to wake up and even think for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me you can&rsquo;t make that day any too
soon, Andy. If you happened to find yourself
cast adrift on a big desert you would be sorry
you delayed so long, though, if you pulled
through alive, it might be the making of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll buckle down to the job without being
forced that way,&rdquo; Andy hurriedly assured the
scout leader. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the next thing on the
program?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re just dying to get into the
amusement section of the Exposition called the
Zone, and which is a good deal like the Streets
of Cairo and the Midway of the Chicago Fair.
I&rsquo;ll make a bargain with you, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; let&rsquo;s hear the particulars,&rdquo; exclaimed
the other eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; began Rob, &ldquo;I want to get rid
of this suitcase, and we&rsquo;ll make for that tobacconist&rsquo;s
odd booth, to leave it with him until
we&rsquo;re going back to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s over this way, past the big California
building, with the Oregon one that has a colonnade
of logs alongside. Well, after we&rsquo;ve
shunted the bag on the man who runs the tobacco
shop, what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put in the rest of the morning,&rdquo; Rob
explained, &ldquo;in rummaging through some of these
places clustering around the Tower of Jewels.
I&rsquo;ve got a string of things I&rsquo;m wild to see, and
that&rsquo;s as good a place to make a start as anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That brings us to noon, when we agreed to
meet Hiram, you remember, for lunch?&rdquo; Andy
reminded his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I understand there are dozens and
dozens of eating places to be found in the Zone.
If you want you can have an Arab dinner, a
Chinese chop suey, a French meal <i>&agrave; la carte</i>, a
German one, or anything your taste calls for.
So we might as well head that way for our lunch,
and pick out a place that seems to promise good
things for hungry fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! after I once get inside the Zone, Rob,
nothing can drag me out again for the whole afternoon.
So, I hope you&rsquo;ve concluded to make a
sacrifice, and devote the rest of the day to keeping
me company in roaming around among all
the queer sights they tell me you can run up
against there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob nodded his head and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you that, Andy, because I know
you too well to believe there could be any peace
until you have had your way. Yes, and I admit
that I can get a lot of enjoyment out of seeing
all those foreign things, as well as the more important
exhibits in Machinery Hall and such
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; said Andy, with an assumption
of great sagacity. &ldquo;In one case we are shown
wonderful development in the world&rsquo;s progress
along the lines of science and commerce; while
in the Zone you can see man himself as he appears
all over this ball, how he lives, what his
forefathers have done for ages and ages in the
past, and in fact study human nature. To me
that is better than gaping at some machine I
never could understand in a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>By this time they had reached the shop where
arrangements had been made with the obliging
proprietor to act as a medium of exchange between
the three scouts during their stay. The
empty suitcase was disposed of and once more
the boys started out to gaze upon some of the
myriad strange sights that were to be met with
on every hand.</p>
<p>Doubtless Rob took a considerably greater
amount of interest in what they viewed during
those several hours than did his companion,
though now and then Andy managed to display
more or less enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It would be utterly impossible to mention the
things they saw as they wandered hither and
thither about that section of the grounds. Even
a guide-book of the Exposition would have to
skim over the details, such were the numberless
attractions on every hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Getting on toward noon, Rob!&rdquo; suggested
Andy, finally, as he laid a hand on his stomach,
as if to call attention to the fact that it was unusually
flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s Hiram coming this way, too, as
if he was beginning to remember his promise to
meet us for lunch. I wonder if we can keep him
with us the rest of the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you get a rope and tie him,&rdquo;
chuckled Andy, &ldquo;for he&rsquo;s clean gone daffy over
the line of exhibits he fancies most, and will
haunt that part of the Exposition nearly all the
time we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram caught sight of them about that moment,
and hurried over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just on the way to the meeting-place,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;Knew it was near grub time and
wanted to get it over with. Say, they&rsquo;ve got the
greatest lot of things worth while on exhibition
over there in the building devoted to inventions
you ever saw. And the aviation field is a peach.
My stars! but they&rsquo;re a busy bunch of willing,
hustling workers there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob had been studying the other&rsquo;s face, and it
told him something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You found your firm represented there, of
course, Hiram?&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course they are, and cutting some high
jinks, too,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got some
of their finished products working in the field,
with air pilots of national renown in charge of
the flights. You must get over that way some
time and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, perhaps before the day is done,&rdquo; Rob
assured him; &ldquo;but I suppose now, Hiram, you
didn&rsquo;t introduce yourself to the Golden Gate people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw. I just took it all in, and browsed
around everywhere, laughing to myself to think
how surprised they were going to be when they
found out that the Hiram Nelson, inventor of
the wonderful stabilizer for a&euml;roplanes, was only
a Boy Scout. But what are we going into the
Zone for, tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to get something to eat, to be sure,&rdquo;
remarked Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m no cannibal,&rdquo; expostulated Hiram,
holding back in pretended alarm; &ldquo;even if they
do have that stripe of people here on exhibition.
I don&rsquo;t hanker after trying a roast Fiji Islander,
or a fricasseed Igorrote from the Philippine
Islands&mdash;I&rsquo;m not <i>that</i> hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Andy told him, tugging at his sleeve,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll find a thousand places here where they
cook meals after the fashion of every nation under
the sun. I hope we pick out one that is close
to that giant seesaw; because I&rsquo;m wild to go up
in it so as to get a magnificent view of the harbor,
the Exposition grounds and the City of
San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was found to be an easy matter to accomplish
this, and they were soon being served at a
table that stood out-of-doors, so that as they enjoyed
their lunch they could watch the endless
procession of people passing and repassing.</p>
<p>As so many attractions in the amusement concession
were connected with foreign countries,
it was really almost as good as being abroad to
see the various representative types that sauntered
or hurried by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how many of those Arabs, Turks,
Algerians, Persians, Hindoos, Hottentots and
others are the real thing, and how many rank
fakes,&rdquo; suggested Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than anybody can tell,&rdquo; laughed
Rob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the easiest thing to put stain on the
skin of an Irishman, dress him in the Oriental
style, clap a red fez on his head, and then call him
a Turk. Only he has to keep his tongue tight-locked;
because his brogue would give him away.
If you listen to them chattering in their own
tongue you can tell which are the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; spoke up Andy, frankly, &ldquo;I just
don&rsquo;t question any of them, but take it for granted
they&rsquo;re what they make out to be. And I
want to say, fellows, it&rsquo;s the biggest treat to me
to be here, watching the congress of all the nations
and people on the globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram&rsquo;s lip curled and he snickered, but Andy
pretended not to hear. To Hiram&rsquo;s mind any
one who could confess to caring for such frivolous
things when there was a building not far
away just jammed with the most marvelous inventions
known to modern science and ingenuity&mdash;well,
it bordered on silliness. But then &ldquo;many
men, many minds,&rdquo; and perhaps it is just as
well that people do not all think alike. There is
a deal of truth in that old proverb to the effect
that what is &ldquo;one man&rsquo;s food may be another&rsquo;s
poison.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>So they sat there for a long time while the procession
of Head Hunters from Borneo, natives
of the island of Ceylon, South American <i>vaqueros</i>
in their picturesque attire, pigmies from the
heart of Africa, Mexican bull-fighters, Moros
from our island possessions in the Orient, Chinese,
Japanese, Servians, Tyrolese mountain
climbers and yodlers, and a multitude of others
continued to pass, many of them coming from the
villages and side shows of the great amusement
park.</p>
<p>From time to time the amazing arm of the
giant A&euml;roscope would project up against the
heavens, the car filled with those visitors who
wished to obtain a view of their surroundings.</p>
<p>Every time it arose, slowly but majestically,
Andy would stop talking to gape and watch, as
though just then the one longing in his heart was
to take that skyward trip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Rob knew it would be the very first thing Andy
would want to do after they left the table; and
indeed, he was not feeling at all averse to complying
with such a request, for it seemed as if
the extensive view to be obtained must be well
worth the price charged for the trip aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred and sixty-five feet they say in
the guide book,&rdquo; Andy gushed; &ldquo;and all for a
small sum in the bargain. I wouldn&rsquo;t miss that
sight for ten times fifty cents. Why, only for the
Rockies being in the way, with a <i>real good</i> glass
you might get even a peep in at Hampton town,
unless one of those nasty sea fogs blocked you
off,&rdquo; and then, of course, he had to laugh himself
at the idea of any glass being able to cover a distance
of something like three thousand miles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">A STRANGE MEETING IN THE AIR.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hiram, it&rsquo;s only fair that you stay with us
for a while this afternoon,&rdquo; Rob mentioned as
they were leaving the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I expected to put in say an hour or so
with you, Rob; and then later on I hope you&rsquo;ll
make your way over to the aviation field, where
you&rsquo;ll just as like as not find me hanging around,
still picking up points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bargain, then, is it?&rdquo; demanded Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say,&rdquo; Hiram declared. &ldquo;I guess
now I c&rsquo;n hit on the fust thing our chum Andy
here&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; to do. I&rsquo;ve been watchin&rsquo; him
stare at that old arm every time she rose up with
the car; and I see we&rsquo;re headin&rsquo; that way right
fast now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a good idea to take that trip the first
thing,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;because you get a comprehensive
idea of the lay of the land that serves you
better than any map you can buy. They don&rsquo;t
stay up very long, though, because there are more
dollars waiting to be picked up from the crowd
that&rsquo;s always in line to occupy the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred and sixty-five feet up is going
some,&rdquo; muttered Hiram. &ldquo;I hope now they don&rsquo;t
have any accident to the machinery while we&rsquo;re
taking our look. I must see how they work this
trick; it ought to be interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have started to carry out this intention
then and there only that Andy held on to
his coat and would not let go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The machinery part can keep, Hiram,&rdquo; the
impatient one declared. &ldquo;Some time when you&rsquo;re
alone poke around all you like; but my tastes run
in another channel. You&rsquo;re like the geologists,
with your nose pointed toward the ground all the
while; I&rsquo;m built more after the style of the astronomers
who keep looking up and see the glories
of the firmament that beat the fossils all hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! you don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; was all the remark Hiram
made, but it contained considerable skepticism
concerning Andy&rsquo;s sweeping assertion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>They fell in line, and were fortunate enough
to be able to get aboard without having to wait,
as they might have done later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This thing must have cost a raft of money
to build; it beats the old Ferris Wheel to pieces,
I should think; and that was a wonder in its day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Andy, &ldquo;but think of the money
they must take in, running it all the time from
February up to December. Why, I should think
they&rsquo;d have millions of passengers in that time,
and at so much a head it would be like a regular
gold mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About that time the car was closed and locked,
so that by no mischance could any reckless passenger
be tempted to jump when it was high in
the air, so as to accomplish a spectacular suicide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve got the windows screened in,
too,&rdquo; remarked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They knew you were coming, I kinder guess,
and wanted to make sure you wouldn&rsquo;t lose your
head up there so as to fall overboard,&rdquo; Hiram
told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>The car was crowded, so that they could not
see who all of their fellow passengers were.
There was also considerable shouting going on,
some of those aboard bidding farewell to friends
who had been unable to make that trip, as though
they fully expected to keep right on going up,
once they got started toward the blue heavens
overhead, until they landed in Glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she goes!&rdquo; announced Andy, eagerly, as
the car was felt to vibrate.</p>
<p>With that they left the ground and commenced
to ascend. The motion was fairly steady, as the
weights on the other end of the great seesaw
had been adjusted to correspond to the number
of those in the car, so that after all the engine did
not have a great deal of hard work to do in lifting
that load.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! I only hope none of the balancing
weight slips off!&rdquo; said Hiram, who appeared to
be rather nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you, Hiram,&rdquo; remarked Rob;
&ldquo;it seems queer for a fellow who aspires to be a
bold air pilot some of these fine days, and who
has even been up several times as high as three
thousand feet, to be shivering with fear now,
when at the most we&rsquo;re only going to get three
hundred odd feet from the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s a horse of a different color,&rdquo;
Hiram explained; &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re up in an a&euml;roplane
it depends on your own self whether you
come down safe, or have an accident. In this
case you haven&rsquo;t got a single thing to do with it,
but just trust to a mechanic, who may be as reliable
as they make &rsquo;em, but could make a mistake
just once. That&rsquo;s what gets my goat; my
efficiency don&rsquo;t count for a cent in this game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is something in that,&rdquo; Rob admitted;
&ldquo;but let&rsquo;s try to find a place and look out as
we keep on rising. Already the view seems to
be getting pretty fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was more or less talking and laughing
and all that in the car, for when there happens
to be a spice of danger connected with any of
these amusements many people become half hysterical.</p>
<p>The view was, indeed, becoming grand, as Rob
had said, and both boys were soon copying Andy,
who was staring first one way and then another,
as sea and shore began to be spread out before
him like a Mercator&rsquo;s chart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Although the huge arm of the giant A&euml;roscope
had by no means reached the upper limit of its
sweep, the great buildings lying below had the
appearance of squatty &ldquo;ant-heaps,&rdquo; as Andy
termed them; and the crowds that swarmed many
of the walks of the Exposition looked so minute
that it was hard to believe they were human beings.</p>
<p>All at once, the working arm of the big seesaw
stopped with a rude jerk that caused a number
of girls aboard to give vent to cries of alarm.
Even strong men had a nervous look on their
faces, Rob immediately noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this mean?&rdquo; demanded Hiram, laying
a hand on Rob&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t reached the highest sweep yet,
I&rsquo;m dead sure,&rdquo; complained Andy, in a petulant
tone, just as though he believed the management
meant to cheat those aboard out of the full benefit
of their money. &ldquo;We want a better view than
this. All the others went to the top, and I don&rsquo;t
see why we shouldn&rsquo;t, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob, this stop wasn&rsquo;t meant, was it?&rdquo; demanded
Hiram, insistent as usual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so loud, Hiram,&rdquo; he was advised.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only frighten those girls all the more if
they happen to hear you. No, I don&rsquo;t believe it
was intended that we stop this far up, and with
such a bump, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is there any real danger of an accident?
I wouldn&rsquo;t care so much if I had my new-fangled
parachute with me, and could only get outside;
for even if the old car did drop, I&rsquo;d be able to
sail down like a feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger&mdash;of course not a bit,&rdquo; Rob told him
sternly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose the managers of
this big Exposition would allow a mechanical affair
like this A&euml;roscope to be run day after day
unless the owners had made it absolutely accident
proof. Just hold your horses and we&rsquo;ll soon be
moving again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Hiram,&rdquo; said Andy just then, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
put yourself on a par with those silly screeching
girls over there, who are hugging each other so.
Poor things, they don&rsquo;t know any better! But
you&rsquo;re a scout, Hiram, and have been taught
never to show the white feather. Brace up!
You&rsquo;re wearing khaki right now, and for the sake
of the cloth show yourself a man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>That brought Hiram to a realization of the
fact that he was indeed hardly proving himself
a worthy scout. He pretended to be indifferent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! who cares?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I do
wish them girls&rsquo;d let up on their racket; it gets
on a feller&rsquo;s nerves to hear &rsquo;em shriek that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know what ails the old thing!&rdquo; suddenly
announced Andy, with a grin on his face
that told how his love for joking exceeded any
faint feeling of alarm that may have seized upon
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it, then!&rdquo; demanded Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you had only guessed it before we
started it would have saved lots of bother!&rdquo;
called out Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They miscalculated the weight, you see!&rdquo; continued
Andy. &ldquo;Some fellows are so deceptive in
their looks. Now right across from us there&rsquo;s
a fat boy with his back turned this way, and staring
hard out of the window. I bet you they figured
wrong on him, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve got
stuck up here four-fifths of the way to the top.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>The other two now looked, and owing to some
of the passengers in the car crowding together
an opening was made like a little lane. At the
end of this they discovered, just as Andy had
said, an exceedingly fat boy occupying more than
his share of space, with his chubby legs braced
under him, and his face pressed against the
heavy wire netting that covered the open windows.</p>
<p>Rob stared, and looked more closely. He half
opened his mouth to make some sort of remark,
and then as though seized with a second thought,
refrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so, Andy?&rdquo; asked Hiram,
in a half-awed way, as though he actually took
some stock in the ridiculous assertion made by
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell me a better explanation if you know
one!&rdquo; demanded Andy, which was a queer way
of clinching an argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the quickest way to mend matters would
be for you to go over there and toss the heavy-weight
overboard, don&rsquo;t you think, Andy?&rdquo; asked
Rob, entering into the spirit of the joke, especially
since he really believed he held the whip-hand
over the fun-loving Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! think so, do you, Rob?&rdquo; said Andy,
making out as though he felt in a fighting humor.
&ldquo;Well, now, perhaps that would be the easiest
way to fix things. I&rsquo;ve got a good mind to try it.
Watch my smoke, Hiram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he actually squared himself, rolled
up the sleeves of his coat, and even started across
the car. Hiram turned pale. He seemed to forget
that there was no possible way in which any
one inside the car could manage to effect their escape
so long as the great arm of the giant seesaw
was elevated in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob, are you going to stand for that?&rdquo; he
burst out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use trying to stop him now, Hiram,&rdquo; he
was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at him squaring off, Rob, like he
really means it!&rdquo; cried Hiram. &ldquo;It would be just
like Andy, he&rsquo;s so rash, you know, to get us all
arrested. What if he did knock that fat boy off
the car! Why, Rob, don&rsquo;t you see the sudden
jolt when the weight was changed might make
us fly up, and bring about a catastrophe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, it might, Hiram,&rdquo; said Rob, trying
hard to keep a straight face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s too late to stop him, Rob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see it is,&rdquo; replied the scout leader, and
somehow there was not much of excitement about
either his voice or his manner, only an apparent
inane desire to grin, Hiram thought as he looked
at his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, he&rsquo;s actually grabbed hold of the fat
boy, and is trying to lift him up so as to get him
out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little off there, Hiram. Seems to me
I would say Andy was trying to hug the poor fat
boy, because he&rsquo;s certainly thrown his arms
around him, and acts as if he might be glad to
meet him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Rob, whatever can that mean! He is
acting just as you say, and it seems to me Andy
isn&rsquo;t doing all the hugging, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Rob broke into a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what it stands for, and you won&rsquo;t
tell me a thing, which I think is a mean job,&rdquo;
complained Hiram.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look again,&rdquo; Rob told him. &ldquo;Now the fat
boy happens to have his face turned this way.
Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ve seen that same moon
phiz before, Hiram? Doesn&rsquo;t it somehow take
you back to dear old Hampton, and the many
jolly times we&rsquo;ve had on our camping trips? Say,
you ought to know that boy, Hiram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he could catch his breath, Hiram
gave a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, consarn my picture if it isn&rsquo;t our chum,
Tubby Hopkins!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">FOUR SCOUTS IN THE WHIRL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s join them,&rdquo; suggested Rob, as
he led the way over to where Andy Bowles and
the stout youth had started to shaking hands as
though they never meant to stop, chattering away
like a pair of magpies, and utterly unmindful of
the fact that others aboard the car were shrieking
aloud with growing fear.</p>
<p>But as it happened just then, whatever may
have been the cause for the sudden stoppage of
the car suspended in midair, the trouble seemed
to have been rectified; for even as Rob led Hiram
over to the other pair of Hampton boys, the upward
passage was resumed as smoothly as though
nothing had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well! if this isn&rsquo;t the biggest surprise
ever!&rdquo; Tubby exclaimed as he seized upon a hand
of each of the two newcomers, and then looked
around just as if he had begun to believe the
whole of Hampton Troop of Boy Scouts must
have come on to take in the sights of the big
show.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only three of us, Tubby,&rdquo; Rob told him.
&ldquo;We consider ourselves the luckiest scouts in
the whole U. S. A. to get a chance to make this
side of the slope. Of course we knew you were
out here somewhere, but you might as well hunt
for a needle in a haystack as to think to find
anyone in this mob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me, won&rsquo;t you, please, how did you
make it?&rdquo; asked Tubby, whose round, rosy face
seemed redder than ever under all this excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till we get down out of this high box,&rdquo;
said Hiram. &ldquo;We came up here on purpose to
get the grand view, you know. Besides, there
are too many ears around for <i>my</i> private business
to be talked over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Tubby, surveying the speaker
with more respect than he had ever before felt
toward Hiram, whose many attempts to invent
wonderful things had never been taken seriously
by his companions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Hiram is right,&rdquo; said Rob. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll only
be up here a short while, so let&rsquo;s use our eyes the
best we can. It&rsquo;s well worth coming a long way
just to get such a panoramic view of the City,
Bay and Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Panoramic&mdash;whew!&rdquo; whistled Andy; &ldquo;but I
guess that covers the ground as well as any word
you could scare up, Rob; for it is a panorama a
whole lot better&rsquo;n any I ever saw painted on canvas,
like the Battle of Gettysburg and such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They remained at their several posts drinking
in the wonderful features of the magnificent view
until finally the machinery was set in motion
again, and they found themselves being gradually
lowered toward the ground. The buildings
lost their squatty appearance, the moving throngs
of human beings ceased resembling crawling flies,
and finally the four boys issued from the cage
satisfied that they had experienced a sensation
worth while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s sit down here in the shade for a
little while, where we can talk,&rdquo; suggested Tubby
Hopkins, who had been one of the scouts with
Rob over in Belgium and France on the previous
late summer and fall when the war was going
on, and consequently could be looked on as having
passed through some lively experiences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little while,&rdquo; agreed Andy; and Hiram,
after looking longingly away, no doubt in the direction
of the quarter given up wholly to recent
remarkable inventions, seemed to resign himself
to martyrdom for a spell, for he, too, found a
seat close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell it all to me,&rdquo; demanded Tubby, &ldquo;because
I&rsquo;m just sure it must be a story worth
hearing. What happened to bring you three fellows
out here? Did some one die and leave you
his fortune? It takes a pretty hefty wad of
money to pay all the expenses of a jaunt across
the continent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor guess that time, Tubby,&rdquo; said Rob.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have pity on you, and give you the details
before you lose weight trying to hit on the true
explanation. To begin with, Hiram won the trip
his own way, while Andy and myself just happened
by a stroke of good luck to run upon our
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell that to the marines, will you, please?&rdquo;
scoffed Tubby. &ldquo;Things don&rsquo;t just happen to
you that way, Mr. Assistant Scoutmaster Blake.
Every time I&rsquo;ve known you to get a thing you
earned it by the sweat of your brow. I&rsquo;d rather
believe it was the other way, and that Hiram had
dropped on a piece of good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mebbe I did, Tubby; but then I showed
perseverance and grit such as a true scout should
allers possess, they say; and so I claim I earned
my right to be out here at the Exposition. Go
on and tell him the hull story, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that he was expected to undertake the
job of being spokesman for the entire party, Rob
started in. He was not the one to embellish facts,
or try to make things seems of more importance
than they really were. Indeed, if anything, Rob
was apt to go to the other extreme, especially
if he figured at all in a leading r&ocirc;le in the narrative.</p>
<p>In this way Tubby was finally put in possession
of all the needful information connected with
their coming. He heard about the smart way in
which Hiram had conducted his negotiations by
mail with the company that made a specialty of
aviation goods, and which apparently had so
much faith in his patent stabilizer that they had
advanced sufficient funds to enable the inventor
to come out and visit them at their headquarters
in San Francisco.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Then followed the account of how Rob and
Andy had been of such signal service to Captain
Jerry and his famous scientific passenger at the
time the old naphtha launch took fire while crossing
the bay to Collins&rsquo; Point; together with what
resulted from that rescue.</p>
<p>It was all very interesting to Tubby, who asked
many questions when he thought Rob was holding
back certain facts that had a direct bearing
on the narrative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my uncle has gone up to Portland
for a week or more on business,&rdquo; Tubby told
them. &ldquo;He left me to enjoy myself at the Exposition
as I pleased. I&rsquo;m not going around in my
scout clothes, but I&rsquo;ve got the khaki suit at the
hotel; and now that I&rsquo;ve met you fellows, of
course, I mean to wear it right along, even if I
astonish the natives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boys wearing khaki are such a common
sight these days!&rdquo; Rob told him in a consoling
way, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d not be apt to attract any person&rsquo;s
attention, even if you are stouter than any
other scout going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve met quite a few of the boys and
chatted with them, too,&rdquo; admitted Tubby. &ldquo;You
see, I always make it a point to wear my badges
under my coat even if I am in mufti&mdash;is that
what they call it, Rob, when a military officer
dresses in civilian garb? Yes, the scouts are
everywhere, and it doesn&rsquo;t surprise you one bit
when you see a couple of them taking part in
a camel race, as I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having finished their explanations, and urged
on by the impatient Andy, the little party began
to make the rounds of the amusement zone. It
was laid out on such an extensive scale that one
could hardly expect to do it justice in one afternoon;
indeed, Andy announced that he anticipated
putting in a full week there, taking in the
sights, and feasting his eyes on the wonders that
had been collected from the four corners of the
earth for this special occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we can see in miniature what
some of us have actually looked on before when
building&mdash;the working of the great Panama Canal,&rdquo;
announced Tubby, as they arrived at the
panorama section. &ldquo;Shall we pay and take chairs
on the moving platform for a trip around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course there was not a dissenting voice, for
they were boys, and had plenty of spare change
and wanted to see all the sights, at least once.</p>
<p>After that nothing would do for Andy but
that they must embark on the train for a trip
through the Grand Canyon of the Colorado,
which was well executed with regard to color effects
so as to excite their ardent admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorely tempted to take that side trip
on the way here,&rdquo; Rob confessed. &ldquo;We could
have done it easily enough, but you see I didn&rsquo;t
know what to do with that priceless stuff we had
charge of for Professor McEwen. I couldn&rsquo;t
carry it on mule back, and didn&rsquo;t dare leave it
behind at the hotel. Besides, we promised him
we wouldn&rsquo;t linger on the way going, but do
all our sight-seeing coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fix it with uncle,&rdquo; asserted
Tubby eagerly, &ldquo;so that I can hold on with you
fellows if he has to return sooner, or by another
route. I believe I&rsquo;d enjoy seeing the Selkirks up
in Canada first-rate, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about
that wonderful scenery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to have you along, Tubby,&rdquo; said
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goes without saying,&rdquo; added Hiram;
while Rob smiled, and nodded in a way that
Tubby knew meant &ldquo;those are my sentiments,
too, every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next thing on the program was seeing
Yellowstone Park, another scenic trip so realistic
that Andy declared he would always have
trouble convincing himself he had not actually
been through the National Reservation where
the hot springs and geysers flowed, some of the
latter rising a hundred and fifty feet into the air,
with steam and vapor forming a dense canopy
around.</p>
<p>It was just after they had come out from this
that the absence of Hiram was discovered.
Tubby professed to be somewhat alarmed, and
feared their old chum might have fallen from
the observation car; but Rob set his mind straight
when he admitted that he had seen Hiram sneaking
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d reached his limit of endurance,&rdquo; he told
Andy when the latter expressed his opinion of
one who cared so little for amusement; &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ve got to remember that our chum is a queer
fish at best. Besides, his heart is wrapped up
in things along a certain line. Let him go his
way; and later on, perhaps, when some of us
have grown a little tired of all this clatter in the
Zone, we&rsquo;ll hunt up the aviation field and see
what Hiram is doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy had many more things on his list, but
Rob told him not to try and rush it all into one
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, Andy,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;&lsquo;Rome
wasn&rsquo;t built in a day,&rsquo; you remember. We&rsquo;re
going to be around these haunts for a good long
while, and one by one we can see all the shows
that are gathered here&mdash;that is, all worth seeing.
These odd people from the wilds interest me considerably,
too, so that I wouldn&rsquo;t miss looking
in on their villages, where they&rsquo;re genuine, as
most of them are, because the management stand
for that fact.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>It may have been nearer four o&rsquo;clock than
three, when, being more or less tired with their
first day at the Exposition, the three chums
turned their faces in a quarter that up to then
none of them had visited save Tubby, and he
only casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a look in at the a&euml;roplane boys
first,&rdquo; said Rob; &ldquo;and if we don&rsquo;t run across
Hiram there, we will go over to the building
where he says many of the latest inventions are
on exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not difficult to discover which way to
go, for overhead several a&euml;roplanes were whizzing
this way and that. Far up in the heavens
they could see a small speck which was no doubt
some daring pilot trying for an altitude record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes me think of those days over in Belgium
and France, eh, Rob?&rdquo; remarked Tubby
Hopkins, &ldquo;where we saw German and French and
British and Belgian fliers; yes, and even a big
Zeppelin that was meaning to bombard some
city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Andy told them, &ldquo;here we are on the
field, and like as not we&rsquo;ll find our aviation mad
chum over in that crowd around the machines
on the ground, where the starts are made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think those must be the various models
of new machines,&rdquo; observed Rob, and immediately
adding, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Hiram now; he&rsquo;s sighted
us, and is heading this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with a grin as big as a house on his
face,&rdquo; asserted Tubby; &ldquo;which I take it must
mean he&rsquo;s struck something that tickles him just
fierce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram joined his three comrades a minute
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, in a mysterious fashion, addressing
himself particularly to Rob, &ldquo;the Golden
Gate A&euml;roplane Manufacturing Company has a
contraption on one of their machines, intended to
equalize shifting weights; but shucks! it isn&rsquo;t in
the same class with my dandy little stabilizer.
I guess they mean business in my case, with a
big B.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">TUBBY IS OUT OF HIS ELEMENT.</span></h2>
<p>If there had arisen any doubt in Hiram&rsquo;s mind
as to the deep interest those chums were taking in
his enterprise, it must have been quickly dispelled
when he made this announcement, and saw the
looks of delight spreading over their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best wishes, Hiram!&rdquo; added Tubby, genially,
as he patted the other fondly on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Rob did not say anything, but if looks could
speak Hiram might easily see that he had the sincere
sympathy of the scout leader; though he
knew that much before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I&rsquo;ve been hovering around here,&rdquo; continued
Hiram, &ldquo;making myself useful whenever
a flier was going up by running with the machine
to give it a good start, I&rsquo;ve kept my eyes and ears
wide open, let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So as to learn all you could about the Golden
Gate Company, of course?&rdquo; remarked Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hiram told him, frankly enough, &ldquo;and
soak in any sort of knowledge that might be useful
to a feller that&rsquo;s got the aviation bee abuzzin&rsquo;
in his bonnet. And I&rsquo;ve learned a heap, let me
tell you, boys. Why, it&rsquo;s paid me already for my
long and arduous trip across country. I c&rsquo;n start
on as many as <i>three</i> schemes I&rsquo;ve been hatchin&rsquo;
in my fertile brain this long time. I was up agin&rsquo;
a blank wall, you see; but now I&rsquo;ve got ideas
worth a hull lot to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds all right, Hiram,&rdquo; Rob told him;
&ldquo;only I hope you go slow about this business.
Don&rsquo;t overdo it, or we may have to take you
home in a strait-jacket yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixey, not for me,&rdquo; jeered the other; &ldquo;my
head&rsquo;s as clear as a bell. Fact is, I never felt half
as bright as I do now. The clouds have been
scattered, and seems like the sun was shinin&rsquo; all
the time. Once I get this stabilizer business well
off my hands, and have some coin to go to work
with, you&rsquo;ll see the dust fly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he belongs to the Eagles, too!&rdquo; said
Tubby, in wrapt admiration. &ldquo;Seems as if you
just <i>can&rsquo;t</i> suppress &rsquo;em, no way you try. There
never was a patrol of scouts organized that had
as many bright minds on the roster roll as ours
contains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy immediately took off his campaign hat
and made Tubby a low bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice of you, Tubby, to say such sweet
things of your chums,&rdquo; he remarked, just as if it
sprang straight from his heart. &ldquo;And we want
you to know that with the other seven the name
of Tubby Hopkins will go ringing down the ages
in Boy Scout history as one who always made
his mark. And I can testify to that from my
own personal knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the way in which Hiram and Rob tittered
when Andy said this it could be inferred
that they knew very well to what those last few
words referred. The fact of the matter was that
once upon a time Andy had had the misfortune
to be under a tree when Tubby was knocking
down nuts; and the fat scout, losing his grip on
a limb, came down with tremendous force directly
on Andy, who was flattened out on the
ground like a pancake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>He carried the bruises he received on that occasion
for quite some time; but no one could bear
malice against Tubby, who, scrambling to his
knees, had immediately expressed great solicitude
for his unfortunate comrade, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, excuse me, Andy, I didn&rsquo;t know you were
right under me, or I might have chosen some
other place to land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wonder at me being chained to this
place, do you,&rdquo; asked Hiram, &ldquo;when there&rsquo;s so
much happening all the time, with pilots going up
and coming down, agents explaining the use of
new designs of a&euml;roplanes they are putting on the
market, and everybody &lsquo;talking shop&rsquo;? They
reckon I&rsquo;ve been employed in some place where
they make these fliers, because I know somethin&rsquo;
about them. So they let me help in a lot of
ways. It&rsquo;s fun, I tell you, the best fun I ever
knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyone could see that Hiram was right in his
element. His freckled Yankee face seemed to
glow with enthusiasm, and his little eyes shone in
a way Rob had never noticed before. Indeed, if
the scout leader had been inclined sometimes to
fear Hiram would develop into a harmless crank,
with only vague unreasonable ideas rattling about
in his loose brain, that suspicion was rapidly vanishing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Perhaps it had commenced to have an effect
upon Rob&rsquo;s opinion when he read that letter from
the Golden Gate people. They were hard-headed
business men, and not visionary dreamers; and
surely they would never have advanced all that
money to a strange inventor unless they believed
in him, and meant to attach his genius to the
fortunes of their company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I own up, Hiram,&rdquo; said Andy, as they stood
there and watched the many things that were
going on all the time around them, &ldquo;that there
must be a sort of fascination about this thing
to fellows who have a leaning that way. But
as for me you never could tempt me to climb
up thousands and thousands of feet like the air-pilot
in the monoplane that looks like a swallow
against the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes some nerve, I&rsquo;ll admit, Andy,&rdquo; said
Hiram, modestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! plenty of people may have nerve
enough,&rdquo; objected Andy, &ldquo;but all the same
they&rsquo;d be laboring under physical disabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As how, Andy?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, take our chum Tubby here; you
never could expect him to make a flier, and
bore up into the clouds. In the first place, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to the people down below. He
nearly killed me once by dropping just ten feet;
think what would happen to the poor chap who
happened to get in the way if Tubby came down
from where that aviator is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Tubby had to laugh at that highly
colored supposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one thing sure!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to beg pardon for squashing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of the mess,&rdquo; chuckled Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch that man who has just gone up in a
monoplane. He&rsquo;s the best there is on the Coast,
next to Beachey himself, who is a native of
California. You&rsquo;ll see him turn flip-flaps to beat
the band presently. Why, I&rsquo;ve watched him go
around twice, and as neat as a circus tumbler
would do it off a springboard over the backs
of three elephants. There he goes! What d&rsquo;ye
think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! he&rsquo;s a corker, for a fact!&rdquo; ejaculated
Tubby, as he stood with open mouth, gaping at
the wonderful exploits which the reckless air-pilot
was engineering far up above the earth.</p>
<p>Rob, chancing to turn toward the stout boy,
saw to his amusement that there was something
of a wistful expression on his rosy face. Tubby
could at least feel the charm that this hazardous
sort of life might possess for venturesome boys,
even though he knew he could never hope to
attain any standing in the ranks, owing to what
Andy had well called &ldquo;physical disabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Athletes alone make good air-pilots, and a
fellow who had the shape of a tub would only
be useful as an anchor, or something like that.</p>
<p>Poor Tubby! It did seem that Fate was
cruel to him, since he was debarred from taking
an active part in so many sports such as boys
enjoy. But Nature had at least given him a
cheerful disposition, so that no matter how
keenly disappointed he might be, he never allowed
this to sour his temper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>They stood there and watched the trick aviator
doing what Hiram called &ldquo;stunts.&rdquo; Sometimes
the boys fairly gasped with sudden fear
lest the man aloft had made a miscalculation,
and would come plunging down like a stone to
his death; but his agility and quick wit always
served him faithfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of these fine days something will happen
that he doesn&rsquo;t count on,&rdquo; Rob said, soberly,
&ldquo;a flaw may develop in some part of his machine,
just where it counts the most; and then&mdash;well,
it will be his finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; remarked Hiram, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On how high he happens to be at the time,
you mean?&rdquo; asked Andy. &ldquo;Oh! just a few hundred
feet will be enough to put him out of business
for keeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he is a wise man, and has a patent
Nelson self-acting parachute fastened to him all
the time!&rdquo; declared the other, proudly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
open and allow him to drift slowly down, like
you see hot-air balloon performers come to the
earth after they&rsquo;ve cut loose above.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Hiram!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby;
&ldquo;I reckon folks have got to sit up and take notice,
now that you&rsquo;ve come to town! Young
blood will tell every time. Oh, but I&rsquo;m glad I
met my chums! It was getting mighty lonesome
for me, in a crowd all the time, but with
not a solitary fellow to speak to. And Hiram,
I&rsquo;m glad you coaxed us to come over here. I&rsquo;m
getting interested in flying; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps if I cut down
my feed, and knock off a hundred or so pounds
I might have a show in this business yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they did not know whether Tubby was
joking or really meant it, no one laughed at
his strange remark; for they did not want to
hurt his feelings. But when they glanced from
the corners of their eyes at his girth the absurdity
of his hope was manifest. Perhaps they may
even have remembered a remark once made by
Joe Digby to the effect that Tubby would have
to have an extra big pair of wings given to him
if ever he became an angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another exhibition pilot going to
start up, boys,&rdquo; said Hiram just then. &ldquo;Suppose
we walk over closer, and you can watch me
lend a hand to shove him off on a good start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, let&rsquo;s get closer and see how
things are done,&rdquo; added Tubby, as he bent over,
and, picking up a stick of clear pine that had
caught his eye, he took out his penknife and
commenced to whittle away just as though he
might be the representative Yankee of fiction.</p>
<p>But whittling had always been a favorite occupation
with Tubby; somehow it seemed to soothe
him and cause his thoughts to flow more
smoothly. He never could resist an extra fine
bit of wood, though besides shavings he had
never been known to produce any especial result
from the use of his keen-edged knife-blade.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of people around,
and they seemed to be more or less interested in
the claims made by the representatives of the different
a&euml;roplanes that were being displayed, and
in the practical demonstrations.</p>
<p>Tubby listened with rapt attention as some
of the men talked, explaining what improvements
had been made in the working construction
of the machine just then about to be put to
the test.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Hiram was doubtless dreaming of the hour of
his triumph when one of these a&euml;roplanes would
be equipped with his wonderful stabilizer, and
he might stand there listening to the fulsome
praise of the Golden Gate Company&rsquo;s demonstrator,
before a practical test was made, to
show how impossible it would be for a flying
machine that carried such a life-saving device
to be upset by flaws of wind, or the sudden movements
of the pilot.</p>
<p>When all was ready for the flight, Hiram was
one of those who laid hands on the a&euml;roplane
with the intention of running a score or two
of feet, so as to assist in the start. Unnoticed
by Rob, Tubby, too, had copied Hiram&rsquo;s example,
urged on by some irresistible impulse approaching
madness, perhaps.</p>
<p>When the word was given, and with propeller
whirling, the a&euml;roplane started along on its bicycle
wheels, with a dozen pushers to assist, there
was Tubby in the midst.</p>
<p>Suddenly there arose a series of shouts of
alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>All of the other willing helpers had dropped
off, only Tubby was sprinting furiously after
the a&euml;roplane, which was bumping along over
the ground with ever increasing momentum.
Rob felt a thrill of real alarm when he believed
he saw that the left arm of the stout boy was
drawn out, as though in some unfortunate way
it had become caught in a trailing cord, so that
he was compelled to keep on, no matter how
much he wanted to break away!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">THE ILLUMINATED FAIRYLAND.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Tubby!&rdquo; Andy was heard to cry out
above the clamor.</p>
<p>It was all over in a few seconds. Rob believed
he saw the fat boy manage to get his
other hand out; and it flashed through the scout
leader&rsquo;s mind that the last he had noticed Tubby
was gripping his open knife in that hand.</p>
<p>They saw the stout boy roll over and over like
a big rubber ball. At the same time it became
evident that the shouts of sudden alarm and
horror bursting forth from the crowd must have
warned the aviator that something was wrong,
for he instantly shut off the power, and the
monoplane was now slowing up instead of increasing
its speed over the level ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Rob, Andy and Hiram joined in the forward
rush, everybody fearing the worst with regard
to poor Tubby. But when they arrived on the
spot they were more than pleased to see him
calmly brushing off his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get hurt, Tubby?&rdquo; demanded Andy,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a bit,&rdquo; replied the grinning Tubby.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the good of being encased in fat, you see.
If it had been you, Andy, you would have gotten
a broken rib, or something like that. Oh! thank
you for my hat, mister. Did anybody see my
knife; it slipped out of my hand just as I cut the
cord that was holdin&rsquo; me to the machine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Tubby, if you had the presence
of mind to do that!&rdquo; cried Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s your knife, my boy,&rdquo; said an air-pilot,
advancing. &ldquo;You had a narrow escape,
and if I were you I would let it be the last time
I ever tried to run with a machine. If you had
fallen over you might have been dragged and
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by that cord, I should think, mister,&rdquo;
declared Tubby, holding up the piece that still
dangled from his left arm, where a loop had
accidentally become fast. &ldquo;It would have broke
short on me; but all the same I&rsquo;m through trying
games like that. I&rsquo;m not built for it, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>They were pushing the monoplane back for
another start. The aviator stopped to survey
Tubby from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, it was you holding me back, was it?
Didn&rsquo;t get hurt any, I hope? But looky here,
young fellow, when I want an <i>anchor</i> I&rsquo;ll get a
real one, and not just a tub of jelly; understand
that, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was pretty rough on Tubby, for the crowd
laughed uproariously, but he disarmed the anger
of the air-pilot by joining in the mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant all right, mister,&rdquo; he told the aviator,
&ldquo;and it would have been easy only for that cord
that was hanging out. It got caught around
my arm, and I couldn&rsquo;t break away. Thank you
for letting me off so easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the boys walked away. It had
threatened to be a serious matter at the time,
but now that everything was over Andy and
Hiram were secretly exchanging nods, and
chuckling over the remembrance of their fat
chum sprinting after the swift monoplane, going
faster no doubt than he had ever done before
in all his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see the finish of the rest of the boys in
Hampton when the foot races are on next fall,&rdquo;
Andy complained, in what he meant to be a
serious tone, &ldquo;if you take to doing your practicing
that way, Tubby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Hiram, &ldquo;when it comes to the
point that Tubby can keep along with a racing
a&euml;roplane, or a speeding motorcar, the rest of
us might as well throw up the sponge and quit.
He&rsquo;d make circles around us like Rob&rsquo;s boat the
<i>Tramp</i> could with the old <i>Sea Gull</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your minds easy, boys,&rdquo; Tubby told
them pleasantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out of training.
Once is enough for me. You can have the field
to yourself, Hiram; only if I were you I&rsquo;d quit
that running business. An inventor has no right
to take chances; and what&rsquo;s happened once may
happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I never thought of that, Tubby,&rdquo;
admitted the other, shaking his head seriously.
&ldquo;Just as you say, an inventor has no right to
expose himself like an ordinary person. No
telling what he might not think up some day for
the uplift of the civilized world. He sorter belongs
to science, don&rsquo;t he? Yep, I&rsquo;ll stop chasing
after a&euml;roplanes; but of course I&rsquo;ll have to
go up once in a while in order to keep in touch
with things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about ready to start for the hotel,
Hiram,&rdquo; announced Rob; &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;ve decided
not to introduce yourself to the Golden Gate
people to-day, you might just as well come back
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram sighed, and allowed his glance to rove
over to where the crowd still gathered around
the demonstration station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; he replied with an effort.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be greedy, and overdo things;
but it&rsquo;s giving me a jolt to have to break away
from here. How about you, Tubby; coming
along and have dinner with us to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he is,&rdquo; said Rob immediately.
&ldquo;To-morrow he must change hotels, so he can
be one of our party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you took the words right out of my
mouth, Rob,&rdquo; declared Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it unanimous,&rdquo; added Hiram,
vigorously; &ldquo;so you see there&rsquo;s no way for you
to back fire, and break away from your moorings
from the same old crowd, Tubby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby smiled, and looked pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to know you&rsquo;re appreciated, let me
tell you, boys,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be only too
glad to join you at dinner. Yes, and in the
morning I&rsquo;ll pack my grip so as to change base.
I can leave a letter for Uncle Mark that he&rsquo;ll get
as soon as he comes back from Oregon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that much was settled, and somehow all of
them seemed to feel pleased over the addition to
their ranks. Tubby Hopkins was always like a
breath of Spring and a welcome guest at every
camp fire. Gloom and Tubby never agreed; in
fact he radiated good cheer as the sun does light
and heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of going to the city, and eating
an ordinary dinner at some hotel or restaurant,
when we can get such a corking fine spread
at the place where we had our lunch?&rdquo; asked
Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a whole lot of sense in that,&rdquo;
admitted Rob. &ldquo;We can sit around and get
rested, then go to our dinner before the evening
rush starts in; and by the time we&rsquo;re through,
the illumination of the Exposition will have gotten
fully under way. And that&rsquo;s a sight we&rsquo;re
wanting to see, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram fell in with the idea at once, and Tubby
declared it suited him perfectly. So once more
they headed toward that section of the Zone
where the giant A&euml;roscope lifted up its cage of
sight-seers hundreds of feet every few minutes,
for the eating-place had been close to this spot.</p>
<p>Since they were looking forward to several
weeks at the Fair, no wonder the boys felt very
satisfied and happy. There was so much to see
that they believed they could put in all the time
to advantage without duplicating anything.</p>
<p>When they were seated at the table, Tubby
kept his chums in a constant roar of laughter by
his many quaint remarks. Sometimes these were
called forth by some queer type of foreigner
chancing to pass by; and then again it might be
Tubby would revive some ludicrous memory of
past events in which he had figured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>They certainly seemed to enjoy their &ldquo;feed,&rdquo;
as Tubby called it; it was not unlike a camp supper,
when eaten under such odd surroundings.
Andy openly declared that with so many swarthy
turbaned Arabs strolling by, not to mention
Egyptians, Hindoos, Algerians, Moors, and the
like, he could easily imagine himself away off
on a sandy desert, with camels as the only means
of transportation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes me so thirsty just to think of it that
I have to keep on drinking all the time; so please
get me another cup of coffee, waiter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor excuse is better than none,&rdquo; remarked
Hiram. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m going to have a second
helping of that ambrosia nectar just because I
want it. I don&rsquo;t have to ring in all that taffy
about hot deserts, camels and such stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they were through with dinner
the illumination of the Exposition grounds was
in full blast. It certainly looked like fairyland
to Rob, Andy and Hiram; though the last named
seemed to be more interested in figuring how
an improvement might be made in the wonderful
electrical display than in admiring the amazing
effect of the myriads of colored lights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>The roofs of buildings, the domes, the turrets
and the towers, as well as the Triumphal Arch
of the Setting Sun were all aglow. It made a
spectacle not easily forgotten, and which the
boys were never weary of gazing at.</p>
<p>As all of them felt pretty stiff and tired from
having been on their feet so much that day, and
not being used to it after sitting so long on the
train, it was determined that they would not
linger any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be here on plenty of nights up to the
closing hour,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;and I think it would
be poor policy to overdo things in the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Tubby with the air of an oracle,
&ldquo;I never forget what I was once told, that it&rsquo;s
very unwise to press your horse in the start of
a long journey. Let him generally get used to
going, and by degrees he&rsquo;ll be able to do better
work right along&mdash;and finish strong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Same way,&rdquo; added Andy, &ldquo;the jockeys hold
back racers till they reach the last lap. The one
that&rsquo;s the freshest on the home stretch is the one
that&rsquo;s going to win, nine times out of ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with you, boys, and see all I can
of my chums,&rdquo; announced Tubby, who undoubtedly
hated to spend even one more night alone.
&ldquo;I can engage a room near yours for to-morrow,
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps; and besides, Rob has something he
promised to show me, which won&rsquo;t keep over the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he referred to happened to be some photographs
Rob had taken on the way to California,
and which would have looked just as good
on the next day; but then Tubby was hunting
for even a poor excuse to hang on to the party
as long as he could.</p>
<p>They took a carriage at the exit. At the office
of the hotel they waited until Tubby had interviewed
the clerk, with Rob at his elbow to vouch
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great luck, fellows!&rdquo; announced Tubby, as
he rejoined Andy and Hiram. &ldquo;I got my room
all right, which in itself is a wonder with all the
crowds in the city right now; but would you
believe it I&rsquo;m next door to you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some more of that everlasting Hopkins&rsquo;
luck,&rdquo; Andy told him. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be kept down,
Tubby, no matter how they try it. We&rsquo;ve seen
you bob up on top before now. And look at
you chancing to have that open knife in your
hand this afternoon, when that cord held you!
One chance in ten thousand of such a thing happening,
and yet it did with you. Sometimes I
wish my name wasn&rsquo;t Bowles; if I couldn&rsquo;t have
it that I think I&rsquo;d choose Hopkins. Sounds
lucky to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chattering as they went, the four chums
sought the elevator, and were soon on the fifth
floor where the boys&rsquo; connecting rooms were located.</p>
<p>Rob had secured only the one key at the desk.
With this he opened the door, and stepping inside
reached out his hand to switch on the electric
light. As this flashed up the boys stared
about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong room, Rob, I bet you!&rdquo; exclaimed
Andy. &ldquo;We never left things scattered around
on the floor like this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that looks like your suitcase, Andy; and
this open steamer trunk is mighty similar to the
one we fetched along to hold our extra clothes!&rdquo;
exclaimed Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like somebody had been in here looting!&rdquo;
remarked Tubby, whose eyes seemed as
round as saucers as he turned from one object to
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;ye think of that?&rdquo; cried Hiram,
bitterly; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s my bag turned inside out, just
like some sneak thief had been looking for money
or jewelry. There&rsquo;s been an attempt at robbery
here, fellows, as plain as the nose on my face!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">PRYING FINGERS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s anything missing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Andy made this remark he started to
gather up some of his possessions that strewed
the floor close to his suitcase, where they had
been hastily thrown when the leather receptacle
was emptied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Rob, halting him in the
work; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take a general look around first. It
seems to me as if they hadn&rsquo;t gotten more than
half-way through our trunk. That would indicate
something had alarmed the thief, and caused
him to leave in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mebbe I&rsquo;m not tickled nearly to death!&rdquo;
exclaimed Hiram, suddenly, beaming on the
others as though he felt like shaking hands with
himself over something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; asked Tubby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can give a guess,&rdquo; said Rob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about
the papers we left in the safe downstairs, eh,
Hiram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it is, Rob,&rdquo; admitted the other,
continuing to show his pleasure. &ldquo;Only for your
smartness in getting me to deposit the packet
with the clerk under a seal, it might have been
in my bag right here. Say, I wonder now, if
that was what the thief wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no one out here would suspect that you
carried valuable papers, Hiram,&rdquo; objected Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we know that?&rdquo; asked the other, who
had seized upon that explanation of the mystery,
and saw no reason as yet to abandon his
theory. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you how several companies
I approached had men in their employ who
tried to play smart games on me, so as to steal
the fruits of my labor? Rob, you haven&rsquo;t forgotten
that unscrupulous Marsters, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, but there&rsquo;s a whole lot that would
have to be explained about him before I could
believe he had anything to do with this game,&rdquo;
Rob told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re of the opinion it&rsquo;s just an ordinary
everyday hotel sneak thief who&rsquo;s been looking
through our stuff in hopes of finding some
spare money hidden away in one of our grips,
is that it, Rob?&rdquo; and Andy started in once more
to gathering up his scattered property, rubbing
at the bosom of a shirt where it seemed to be
marked with dirty fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he found anything worth taking,&rdquo;
said Hiram, &ldquo;because we made it a point
never to keep valuables in our bags, outside of
those rolls belonging to your Professor McEwen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything worth a considerable amount had
been stolen,&rdquo; ventured Rob, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have stopped
Andy before now from destroying one of the
finest clues that could ever be found. I mean
that finger-print so plainly marked on the bosom
of your white shirt. With the modern methods
used by the police to fix a crime on a criminal,
that dark impression of his fingers would prove
the fellow guilty in case they could use a drag
net and round-up a bunch of suspects.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Tubby stood and watched the others work,
gathering their belongings together. Both Hiram
and Andy growled occasionally because the thief
in his haste to look through everything had jumbled
things considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want to waste his precious time
for trying to find anything worth while in the
belongings of three boys?&rdquo; Andy asked, as
though he had a personal grievance against the
rogue who had entered their rooms with a duplicate
key, since they had certainly found the door
locked.</p>
<p>Struck with an idea, Rob stepped over to one
of the windows and looked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think he may have climbed in from some
fire-escape, don&rsquo;t you, Rob?&rdquo; demanded Tubby,
who had noted this move on the part of the scout
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea struck me,&rdquo; admitted Rob, &ldquo;but it
only took one look to tell me such a thing is
quite impossible, and out of the question. No,
he must have come in by the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And went out the same way?&rdquo; continued
Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, after upsetting our things in the way he
did,&rdquo; pursued Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose he found out that the owners of the
trunk and bags were only three boys,&rdquo; Tubby
went on to say in his logical way, &ldquo;and then
he threw up the game; no use expecting to run
across jewelry or any extra cash in baggage belonging
to boys seeing the Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like it&rsquo;s the old story over again,&rdquo; Hiram
remarked, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no end to the queer
things we run up against. I&rsquo;m getting so nowadays
I expect some surprise to break in on me
any minute, day or night. If it isn&rsquo;t one thing
then it&rsquo;s another. And when all else fails why
we c&rsquo;n depend on Tubby here to keep the wheels
spinning with some of his antics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antics!&rdquo; echoed Tubby, indignantly. &ldquo;I object
to you giving my adventure of this afternoon
such a name as that. You must think I
would purposely tie myself to a speeding a&euml;roplane,
and then have to run after it just for the
fun of the thing. Antics nothing. Misfortunes,
you&rsquo;d better call my troubles after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind, Tubby! After all, you
didn&rsquo;t get hurt,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;In this case it
looks like the thief had had his troubles for
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a theory,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;but of course
there&rsquo;s no way of proving it. It&rsquo;s connected with
those two fellows who tried to play a smart game
on Hiram here at Los Angeles, and got left for
their pains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! I haven&rsquo;t heard anything about that
up to now,&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby. &ldquo;Who and what
were they, Rob? Ten to one you engineered a
scheme to block them, because it would be just
like Rob Blake to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Andy, having a glib tongue, took it upon
himself to relate the adventure of the through
train, and how the two clever rogues had tried
to get them to enter a carriage as prisoners,
meaning, of course, to rob Hiram as soon as the
chance came.</p>
<p>Tubby laughed when he heard how their plan
was brought to naught. His merriment grew
even more boisterous after he learned that Rob
had taken Hiram&rsquo;s papers to secrete them on his
person, while the other hid some old letters in an
inside pocket, which were deftly &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; during
the short time the boys happened to be in close
touch with the pair of rogues.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just to think of the bitter disappointment
they met with,&rdquo; said Tubby between his gasps.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll remember you fellows with anything
but pleasure. Every time they glimpse a
boy in khaki they&rsquo;ll be apt to utter some hard
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Rob, &ldquo;it was on what they
must feel that I based my theory. You see, they
must have been coming to one of the expositions,
probably the big Panama-Pacific show, to ply
their trade. That would take them here to San
Francisco. By some chance or other they may
have seen us, and found out where we are stopping;
and this raid was carried out more with
a desire to have revenge on us than anything
else. If some one hadn&rsquo;t alarmed the fellows
they might have amused themselves destroying
everything in our bags and trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mean revenge, but I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past a
thief who was boiling mad because three Boy
Scouts had managed to get the better of him,&rdquo;
Andy declared, with considerable emphasis,
which looked as though he rather favored the
theory advanced by the scout leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! I hope this thing isn&rsquo;t as catching
as the measles,&rdquo; ventured Tubby. &ldquo;You know,
I&rsquo;ve gone and paid out some good money for
several things that caught my eye in the booths
at the Exposition; and I&rsquo;d hate to have some
one get away with them during my absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, small chance of that happening, Tubby!
And if you&rsquo;re afraid to stay alone to-night, why,
I&rsquo;ll go over with you to get your bag, and come
on here,&rdquo; Andy told the anxious one.</p>
<p>Perhaps Tubby was at first sorely tempted to
accept that offer; but then he chanced to catch
a gleam of amusement on Hiram&rsquo;s face. That
settled the matter. Pride stepped in and took
the reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind about that, Andy!&rdquo; he hastened
to say. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to offer me
help, but I think I had better wait until morning.
I&rsquo;ll be around early and take breakfast with the
bunch, remember. What time do you eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram and Andy allowed Rob to settle that
for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it eight o&rsquo;clock, then. We&rsquo;ll wait that
long for you, Tubby,&rdquo; the scout leader said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on the move by seven, and as I expect
to pack my bag to-night before turning in, it
isn&rsquo;t going to take me long to finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby got up as though he knew he ought to
be going; but apparently he hated to part from
his chums. They had been together so much of
recent years that they were as thick as peas in
a pod.</p>
<p>Rob somehow did not seem to be altogether
satisfied with the result of his first examination
of the room; he was heard moving around in the
second apartment. When he joined the rest
again, Andy, who must have guessed what he
had been about, began to question Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find anything to give the game away in
there, Rob?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, not that I could see,&rdquo; the scout
leader replied. &ldquo;The door, as you may remember,
is locked, and the key at the office, where we
haven&rsquo;t bothered taking it out. Besides, when
we left this morning I shot the bolt home, so
that no thief could have entered by that door;
and certainly no one left the room that way, or
the bolt would not be in the socket as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, what&rsquo;s the use of bothering about
it? We don&rsquo;t as a rule believe in crying over
spilled milk. If that&rsquo;s the case, why should we
fret when there&rsquo;s been no damage done at all,
except my white shirt being soiled by finger
prints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send that to the hotel laundry and forget it,&rdquo;
advised Tubby. &ldquo;Where did I leave my hat?
Oh, here it is! By the way, don&rsquo;t be surprised
when you see me in the morning, because I expect
to be togged out in my khaki uniform, which
Uncle had me fetch along in my big collapsible
grip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and stand the wonderful sight the
best way we can,&rdquo; Hiram told him; &ldquo;but break
it to us by inches, please, Tubby, so as to avoid
as much risk as possible. I&rsquo;ve got a weak heart,
you know, and a sudden shock might be serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad you made your bargain with the hotel
clerk before you donned your khaki, Tubby,&rdquo;
ventured Andy. &ldquo;He might have given you the
room at half the price you expect to pay for it
now on the European plan. Your presence here
would be a standing advertisement for the place.
They could afford to let you stay for nothing if
only you&rsquo;d agree to stand outside the restaurant
door an hour each day, and pick your teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>All this kind of &ldquo;joshing&rdquo; had no effect on
Tubby, who really seemed rather to enjoy being
a target for these shafts of sarcasm leveled by
his comrades, for his smile was as bright and
cheery as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tie my shoe first, and then skip out. Must
be going on nine o&rsquo;clock now, and I&rsquo;ve got some
lost sleep to make up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying which he dropped down on one knee
and set to work. The others accommodated
themselves to the several easy-chairs, Hiram
swinging one of his long legs over the arm of
his seat in real Yankee fashion.</p>
<p>Rob yawned, and then taking out his little
notebook&mdash;in which he was particular to jot
down every daily event of any consequence on
the trip&mdash;he felt in his pocket for a pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Hiram, you borrowed my pencil
this afternoon, and didn&rsquo;t return it,&rdquo; he remarked,
stretching out his hand toward the other
scout, who, with a sheepish shrug of his shoulders,
fished the article in question out of his vest
pocket and handed it over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>It was just then that Tubby fairly scrambled
to his feet. Rob looked up in some surprise,
when to his further astonishment the fat boy
tiptoed over, bent down, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t give me the grand laugh, Rob,
when I tell you I saw something moving under
that bed there&mdash;a pair of shoes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE THIEF UNDER THE BED.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s that, Tubby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Hiram who whispered this in a rather
hoarse and strained voice. He had managed to
just barely overhear what the fat scout was telling
Rob, and could hardly believe his ears.</p>
<p>Rob instantly held up a warning finger. His
face looked serious for, while after all it might
prove that Tubby&rsquo;s imagination was playing
tricks with him, there were circumstances that
gave the matter a suspicious look.</p>
<p>Some one had certainly been in their rooms
turning things upside-down, as though searching
for articles of value, or with the intention of
creating as much havoc and confusion as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Besides this, had they not already concluded
that this person must have been disturbed in his
vandal work? They believed he had fled, but
after all it was possible that, hearing them at
the door, he had made the utmost haste to conceal
himself in the first hiding place available,
which was under one of the beds.</p>
<p>Rob had to think quickly.</p>
<p>The man must be a desperate rascal or he
would never have taken the chances he did in
entering their apartments bent on such work.
Consequently he would, of course, be armed, and
if given half a chance, might make things exceedingly
disagreeable for the four scouts.</p>
<p>What should be done?</p>
<p>Hiram was already pointing toward the house
telephone, as though suggesting the use of it to
bring help from below. Rob shook his head to
indicate that the plan did not seem to appeal to
him when there might be a better one to adopt.</p>
<p>They were four in number, and pretty husky
fellows in the bargain, who in times past had accomplished
quite a few feats worth mentioning.
It would be too bad if a squad of scouts of their
caliber and experience could not manage in some
way to smother a single concealed thief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Of course, by this time, Andy had come to
realize that there was something very exciting
and mysterious going on. He wanted to burst
out with a plain question, and ask Rob what it
was all about; but reading the signification of
that upraised finger, and the frown on the scout
leader&rsquo;s face, he simply put out a hand and rested
it on Rob&rsquo;s sleeve while a pleading expression
gripped his face.</p>
<p>Taking pity on Andy, and believing that they
must all work together if they expected to accomplish
anything, Rob bent over and whispered
in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s hiding under the bed, Tubby
says. Now laugh out loud as though we were
having a joke; that is to keep him quiet a while
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately Andy Bowles was quick-witted
enough to grasp the peculiar situation. He understood
just why Rob wanted him to make it
appear as though things were moving along as
usual, and that no suspicion had been aroused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>So Andy laughed. If there was a queer,
husky touch to the sounds he emitted to order
surely Andy could hardly be blamed, for he must
have been quivering all over just then from hysterical
excitement.</p>
<p>Rob drew the heads of Tubby and Andy down
close to his mouth. They knew he meant to issue
instructions, and hence eagerly strained their
hearing so that not a single syllable might be
lost. Meanwhile Hiram was standing near by,
and busily engaged in taking off his khaki coat
which, being quite new, he evidently did not
mean to have mussed in any rough and tumble
work.</p>
<p>At another time Rob would have smiled to see
Hiram carefully folding his coat and then softly
depositing it on the bed that was held under suspicion;
but it did not cause a ripple of amusement
to cross his serious face now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Tubby pass around to the other side
of the bed, and try to act as if you were cutting
up,&rdquo; Rob whispered. &ldquo;Keep your eyes on me,
and when I give the word lay hold of his legs
and yank him out. Tubby, we depend on you to
keep him from getting to his feet; squash him
if necessary. Get that, both of you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Both heads eagerly nodded an affirmative reply.
The plan was so extremely simple that there
did not seem to be any possibility of confusion.</p>
<p>Tubby&rsquo;s face was not quite so rosy as usual,
perhaps, but no one could say he looked frightened
in the least. He immediately started some
&ldquo;horse-play&rdquo; with Andy, laughing as he pushed
the other around the foot of the bed so that they
could presently bring up on the other side.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the very first opportunity,
Tubby, even while continuing to pretend
to wrestle with Andy, pointed a finger downward.
Knowing what this was meant for, Andy
ducked his head in order to also get a glimpse
of the object the fat boy considered so suspicious.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Rob and Hiram were holding
themselves in readiness to jump around to any
point where they could make their presence
count. The former was keeping an anxious eye
on Tubby and Andy. When he saw the latter
make that quick movement, Rob knew what it
meant, and understood that considerable would
depend on how Andy came to decide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>So Rob fairly held his breath awaiting the
verdict. If after all Tubby had allowed his imagination
to get the better of him, and had mistaken
some simple object for a pair of shoes under
the bed, Andy&rsquo;s keen eyes would quickly
detect the illusion, and they might expect to hear
him give a roar of amusement.</p>
<p>Nothing of the kind happened, it turned out.
Instead of this, when Andy once more straightened
up he nodded his head toward Rob in a way
that could have only one meaning&mdash;he was ready
to risk his reputation for veracity along with
Tubby in admitting that the facts looked suspicious.</p>
<p>That settled the matter with Rob. They must
combine to make a sudden assault on the concealed
thief and try to overpower him before he
could place himself in a condition to do them
harm.</p>
<p>Like a wise general, the scout leader took one
last look around in order to see that his forces
were all in their respective positions before he
gave the signal that would precipitate action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Andy, impatient to get busy, made a significant
gesture, opening and shutting both hands
rapidly, while a faint grin could be seen on his
face. This was intended to convey the intelligence
that he was eager to lay hold on the lower
extremities of the sneak thief cowering under the
bed, and start to drag him out from his place of
concealment.</p>
<p>There was no need of any further delay, and
so Rob made a quick movement with his hand,
at the same time exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your time; get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the last word had been uttered Andy
was bending down and hurling himself part-way
under the bed. He immediately began to back
out, tugging with all his strength at something
upon which he had pounced.</p>
<p>Tubby also took hold and united his power
with that of the other scout. They made short
work of it, once that combination got started.
Out from under the bed they dragged a struggling
figure that was scratching, clawing and
trying in every possible way to swing around so
that he would not be taken at such a terrible disadvantage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>By that time Rob and Hiram had managed to
arrive, the latter scrambling directly across the
bed in his hurry to get into action.</p>
<p>There was a lively little scene for a brief interval,
with all of them trying to keep those kicking
legs and violently driven arms pinned down.</p>
<div class="img" id="p220">
<img src="images/p220.jpg" alt="There was a lively little scene for a brief interval." width="500" height="635" />
<p class="center">There was a lively little scene for a brief interval.</p>
</div>
<p>A few blows were given in the struggle, and
not all on one side, since Andy had a thrust in
the eye that made the tears come, and Tubby
received a kick which forced a grunt from his
lungs.</p>
<p>Whoever the fellow might be he evidently was
convinced that his condition was desperate, judging
from the wild way he fought, to break away,
with the intention of bolting from the room.</p>
<p>In the midst of the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> Tubby settled the
affair in a unique way all his own, and which
none of the others could have imitated even
though they sought to do so.</p>
<p>He simply allowed himself to sit down squarely
on the squirming figure with which they had been
battling so fiercely. When that heavyweight settled
down, it was like a stone wagon dropping
into a hole in the road. They heard a gasp from
the unfortunate wretch underneath, whose struggles
immediately began to lose much of their
former vigor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>It happened that at the time the thief was lying
on his stomach, so that Tubby perched on his
back, which might have been broken had the fellow
been less sturdily built.</p>
<p>After that there was really nothing more for
the others to do; Tubby was equal to the task
of keeping his victim pinned there in spite of
anything the wretched fellow might try to do.</p>
<p>It was then they heard him wheezing as though
short of breath, and saw his hand moving as if
in abject appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give up! I&rsquo;m all in! Please don&rsquo;t kill me,
Rob and Andy! Won&rsquo;t you let Tubby get up off
my back; he&rsquo;s smashing my ribs, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob, Andy and Hiram stared at each other as
though they hardly knew whether they could be
awake or dreaming. Why, the squirming wretch
whom they found hidden under the bed, and who
had undoubtedly been searching their effects
with robbery in view, had actually mentioned the
name of Rob and that of Andy. Yes, he had
even begged that Tubby be restrained before he
utterly crushed his back and sides!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>It gave them one of the greatest surprises in
all their experience; for how a common hotel
sneak thief should know who they were, and address
them so familiarly, was past their comprehension.</p>
<p>Tubby, too, looked astounded, though he made
no move to get up in response to the pitiful
wheeze of the wretch he was pinning to the floor.
Perhaps it filtered through the slow-moving
brain of the fat scout that this might be only one
of those clever tricks known to sharpers, and
entered into simply to gain some advantage.</p>
<p>Rob knew differently. There seemed to be
something about that whine on the part of the
prisoner that was familiar, though on the spur
of the moment Rob could not have told where
he had last heard it.</p>
<p>Accustomed to prompt action, the scout leader
motioned to Andy and Hiram to hold themselves
in readiness to seize upon the fellow&rsquo;s arms, and
in this manner keep him from taking advantage
of his newly acquired freedom when Tubby
arose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you can get up, Tubby!&rdquo; said Rob.</p>
<p>Tubby thereupon gave one of his satisfied
grunts and commenced to roll off his human
cushion for, as a rule, when he wished to gain
his feet, like the elephant he resembled in many
ways, the fat boy had to get upon his knees first
of all, and then make a further effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn him over, Andy, Hiram; and if he tries
any funny business he&rsquo;ll wish he hadn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s
all!&rdquo; Rob told the others, who immediately
started to obey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, believe me, I&rsquo;ve had enough as it is,
Rob! I hope you won&rsquo;t be too hard on me this
time! I was wild to get back home, and that&rsquo;s
the truth,&rdquo; the fellow was crying as Andy and
Hiram turned him on his back.</p>
<p>The former bent down to stare into the
thief&rsquo;s face. Rob fairly held his breath, awaiting
the explosion something told him was due.
Nor was he mistaken, for Andy drew back, uttering
exclamations of wonder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, who d&rsquo;ye believe it is,&rdquo; he burst out,
&ldquo;but that sneak of a Jared Applegate who had
to skip out of Hampton when things got too hot
for him, and who you last ran across when you
were down in Mexico? Rob, he&rsquo;s up to his old
tricks of trying to steal what belongs to others.
Say, this is one of the biggest surprises that ever
came our way. Old Hiram Applegate&rsquo;s bad boy,
and a common hotel thief!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">AN ENEMY OF THE PAST.</span></h2>
<p>They all recognized Jared now, although he
had grown considerably since last Rob had seen
him, and was a husky looking fellow, easily capable
of doing a man&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>In other days he had been a thorn in the flesh
of the newly organized troop of scouts in Hampton,
doing every mean thing his wits could devise
in order to annoy them. Then, later on,
when some of the boys had visited the Panama
Canal, in process of being dug at the time, they
ran across this same young reprobate, and found
him associated with a number of desperate foreigners
who were trying to blow up the locks of
the canal in order to effect the ruination of the
whole grand project to unite the two oceans
across the isthmus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Still later, Rob had run across Jared down in
Mexico, where he was having a hard time of it,
having joined forces with some of the rival warring
elements that at the time were smashing
things right and left. Whatever became of
Jared, Rob had never learned, nor had he bothered
himself very much over the disappearance
of the unscrupulous young rascal.</p>
<p>And now, to find him trying to steal things
from their baggage, was enough to make them
believe the world was a pretty small affair after
all. Of the hundreds of thousands of people in
San Francisco it was certainly queer that Jared,
their old-time enemy, should be the one to attempt
this thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this checkered jumper he&rsquo;s wearing
mean?&rdquo; remarked Andy, when he could find his
breath, which had really been taken away by the
astonishing discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like Jared might be doing some honest
work at last,&rdquo; added Hiram. &ldquo;Else he&rsquo;s just put
it on to make people believe he belongs here in
the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, that isn&rsquo;t so, Hiram!&rdquo; hastily cried
the wretched Jared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really a sort of porter
here, you see. I fetch trunks up to guests&rsquo; rooms,
and all that. Mebbe you didn&rsquo;t know it, but I
brought that steamer trunk of yours here when
you were out. That&rsquo;s how I got my first knowledge
some of my old schoolmates had come on
to the Fair, because I read the name of Robert
Blake on the same, and Hampton, L. I., ditto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Andy, &ldquo;and you felt so warmly
drawn to your old schoolmates, Jared, didn&rsquo;t you,
that you just couldn&rsquo;t resist sneaking up here
when they were out, and rooting all through
their baggage in hopes of picking up a windfall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wretched Jared groaned in a way that
told how badly he felt, not because he repented
for anything he had done, as Rob well knew, but
on account of having had the ill-fortune to be
caught in the act. That was what pinched the
most, though it was not to be expected he would
admit as much; for Jared had always been one
of those tricky, whining, cowardly fellows who
make big promises when in trouble, but forget
all about them as soon as the wind blows fair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just sick to get back home again, and
that&rsquo;s the truth, I give you my word it is, Rob!&rdquo;
he said, trying to appear very dejected and humble,
because he knew from past experiences that
this was the best way to work upon the sympathies
of these good-hearted former school companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ready to rob us so as to get the money
to take you there, you mean, don&rsquo;t you, Jared?&rdquo;
Rob demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was wicked, I realize that now, but
everything has been against me out here,&rdquo;
whined the one who lay on his back on the floor.
&ldquo;I get to thinking of the folks at home on Long
Island and it seems I would go crazy I want to
get back there so bad again. If I ever do, I&rsquo;m
meanin&rsquo; to be a different feller than in the past.
I&rsquo;ve had my lesson, Rob; I&rsquo;ve been kicked around
like a dog till I came to hate nearly everybody
that lived. But if I could only have one more
chance I&rsquo;d try awful hard to make good, sure I
would. Oh, I hope you&rsquo;ll believe me, Rob Blake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Now Rob, through so many dealings with this
treacherous fellow in the past, had lost all faith
in his possessing the least trait of decency in his
composition. In most bad boys with whom Rob
had ever had anything to do he could discover
some sign of decency, even though it required
considerable searching to find it; but upon Jared
he had come to look as worthless.</p>
<p>All these promises Rob believed were only
made with one idea in view, and this a wild desire
to escape the punishment he so richly deserved.</p>
<p>Caught hiding under the bed after their effects
had been searched and thrown recklessly around,
Jared must certainly be treated as a common
thief if arrested, and the management of the
hotel would take great satisfaction in prosecuting
him if only to discourage other employees
from copying his example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him sit up, boys!&rdquo; the scout leader told
the two who had been pinning both of Jared&rsquo;s
arms to the floor.</p>
<p>They did as Rob requested, but from the way
in which Andy and Hiram seemed to watch the
culprit, meanwhile holding themselves in complete
readiness to hurl their weight upon him at
the first show of aggressive action on his part,
it was evident that they attached small importance
to his claim of repentance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Rob hardly knew what to do. They had no
reason to think well of this scamp who, in the
past, never lost an opportunity to do them an ill
turn, whether in the home town on the shore of
Long Island, down at Panama, or upon the wide
plains of Mexico. In Rob&rsquo;s mind there was no
shadow of belief with regard to that promise of
reformation, or the gnawing desire to return
home.</p>
<p>Still, so far as they knew, nothing had been
stolen, so that there was no real reason why they
should sink so low as to want to revenge themselves
on Jared.</p>
<p>He certainly presented a most pitiable object
as he sat there and turned his anxious eyes from
one face to another of the four boys with whom
he had gone to school for years, and who now
held his fate in their hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I got anything, Rob, I meant to make it
up to you later on when I could earn the money,&rdquo;
he was saying again, mistaking that serious look
on Rob&rsquo;s face and fearful that he meant to turn
him over to the police. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to go back
to the farm and work it with the old man. This
thing of knockin&rsquo; about the world ain&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s
cracked up to be, and I&rsquo;m dead tired of going
hungry half the time. Let me off, Rob, won&rsquo;t
you, please? It&rsquo;d nigh &rsquo;bout kill the old woman
if she learned I&rsquo;d been caught tryin&rsquo; to steal from
my schoolmates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like all cowards, Jared, when he found himself
face to face with the consequences of his
folly, was ready to play the part of the prodigal
son, and bring in his parents as a reason why
he should escape punishment. Rob and the other
scouts knew his mother and father, and while
they had no reason to respect Farmer Applegate,
still the fact that Jared was his son and must
have almost broken the hearts of his people at
home, was bound to influence Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Jared!&rdquo; said the scout leader, shortly.</p>
<p>Andy gave a grunt of displeasure. He could
guess what Rob was about to do, and felt like
expressing his disgust, though it was seldom any
of the boys ventured to differ with Rob, such
confidence did they have in his long-headed policies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Hiram simply contented himself with shrugging
his shoulders. If Rob considered it best
that they let the contemptible sneak thief off, after
catching him in the very act as it were, well,
it must be all right. Scouts were taught that
when a foe was on his back and begging for
mercy they must not be too hard-hearted. Jared
was deceiving them, Hiram felt sure of that, but
after all why should they bother with punishing
him any further?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you meanin&rsquo; to let me go, Rob?&rdquo; quavered
the fellow, as he managed to get upon his
feet, with the four scouts clustered around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because we haven&rsquo;t lost anything
through you as far as we can find out,&rdquo; the scout
leader told him, at which Jared&rsquo;s face lost some
of its strained look, and Andy thought he caught
some of the old-time crafty gleam in his shifting
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you my word for it, Rob, I never took
a single living thing,&rdquo; he hastened to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll make sure of that by taking a
look through your pockets!&rdquo; declared Rob,
sternly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to like that, do you?
But make up your mind that if you start to show
the first sign of resistance we&rsquo;ll not only pile on
you, but hand you over to the police afterward
without listening to any more promises. Andy,
you tap his pockets, and see what he&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy did not hesitate an instant; indeed, to
see the way he started in one might believe this
was an avocation with the scout, and that he had
been employed a long time at police headquarters
searching the pockets of prisoners before
they were thrust into cells.</p>
<p>A number of things were brought to light,
which did not possess any particular interest for
the scouts. When, however, from an inside
pocket Andy drew a roll of bills, fastened with a
rubber band, Tubby was heard to give a &ldquo;whee!&rdquo;
and Hiram nudged Rob in the side as if to say:
&ldquo;See how he yarned when he vowed he wanted
to get back on the farm, but didn&rsquo;t have the railroad
fare East!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy deliberately proceeded to count the contents
of the roll, while the wretched owner followed
his every move, as though he feared that
by some hocus-pocus or sleight of hand process,
with which he himself was possibly familiar,
some of the money might take wings and fly
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just ninety-seven dollars here, Rob!&rdquo; announced
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; declared Jared, cringing
before Rob&rsquo;s look, &ldquo;and I earned every cent of
that roll by honest days&rsquo; labor, every cent of it.
I thought I needed just a little more to see me
through all the way East. I was told it&rsquo;d take
about&mdash;say a hundred and ten clear. But I c&rsquo;n
wait now till I get my next wages. I was a silly
fool to think to rob my old pals of the days in
Hampton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never said truer words than those,
Jared,&rdquo; Rob told him, plainly, but with a feeling
that nothing the other declared would be believed
under oath, for truth and Jared Applegate
had never been friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rob, I hope now you ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to
keep any of my cash roll, or hand it over to the
manager of the hotel. I&rsquo;ve been working here
quite some time now, and they treat me white
so I&rsquo;d hate to get bounced when I&rsquo;m so near
makin&rsquo; up the amount I need. It&rsquo;s all clean
money, Rob, you believe me, don&rsquo;t you? Look
at my hands and see how calloused they are?
That&rsquo;s a pretty good sign, I take it, that I ain&rsquo;t
been layin&rsquo; around, or playin&rsquo; cards like I used
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had certainly been doing some sort of hard
labor, though Rob was rather inclined to believe
Jared must have been working in the mines with
pick and shovel, and had only come to the city
when driven out of the camp because of some
crooked doings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t judge everybody by your own
standard, Jared,&rdquo; he told the other. &ldquo;None of
us could be hired to take a single cent of yours,
no matter how you got the money, which is no
affair of ours. Give it back to him, Andy; and
I guess you&rsquo;ve searched enough to satisfy us he
is carrying away nothing that belongs to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jared clutched the money as might a miser,
and hastened to stow it away again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you mean me to go, don&rsquo;t you, Rob? I
take it you&rsquo;re too high-minded to want to have
revenge on a poor devil who&rsquo;s down in the world,
even if he has done you dirt in the past. Say I
c&rsquo;n skip out, won&rsquo;t you, Rob? I&rsquo;m a changed
boy, I tell you; and you&rsquo;ll never be sorry you
acted white with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door, Tubby,&rdquo; said Rob, and the
fat scout did so, though with apparent reluctance,
for Tubby did not have the slightest faith
in Jared&rsquo;s wonderful reformation, and thought
he ought to be punished in some way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go, and I only hope we never set eyes
on you again, Jared Applegate. Only for the
fact that you&rsquo;ve already brought enough trouble
on the heads of your folks at home I&rsquo;d be in favor
of handing you over to the police to deal
with. Hurry up and leave before I change my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jared did not linger a second longer than he
could help. He gave each of the three scouts a
look, and although he tried to appear grateful,
they could see that there was the same old crafty
gleam in his eyes as though deep down in his
heart there existed not a trace of the desire to
reform of which his lips had boasted. Passing
through the open door, he vanished from their
sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">LOTS OF EXCITEMENT.</span></h2>
<p>After all that excitement, Tubby could not
immediately tear himself away from his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, seems as if all the sleep had been
chased out of my eyes!&rdquo; he declared, as he once
more composedly sat down; and of course a general
discussion took place in connection with
their past experiences with Jared Applegate.</p>
<p>In the end they had to fairly pry Tubby away
from that chair, and put him out of the door, in
a friendly scuffle; he protesting to the last that
as he had no expectation of getting a wink of
sleep that night, there was no need of hurrying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s half-past eleven right now,&rdquo; Andy
told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be a nice lot of blinking owls
to-morrow unless we hit the hay in a hurry. You
come back when you promised, and join the
bunch. Good-night, Tubby!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>With that the door was closed, and of course
the unwilling Tubby found there was no use trying
to change the program; so he headed for the
elevator, smothering a tremendous yawn by the
way.</p>
<p>He made his appearance promptly on time
when morning came, and they started for the Exposition
grounds in a squad, all of them filled
with lively anticipations of another great day of
sight-seeing.</p>
<p>Of course the most anxious one of the company
was Hiram. His business had not as yet
come to a focus, and he was not at all certain
how it might turn out. The others did not wish
to hurry him unduly, for they knew Hiram to
be very set in his ways; but at the same time
they gave him plain hints that he would be unwise
to wait too long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re expecting me any day now,&rdquo; Hiram
had explained in answer to these remonstrances,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m just keepin&rsquo; &rsquo;em on the fence, you see.
When I kinder guess the time&rsquo;s ripe I&rsquo;ll drop in
on the company and tell &rsquo;em who I happen to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hiram means he&rsquo;s engineering a sort of climax,&rdquo;
explained Andy; &ldquo;but the rest of us will
be as mad as hops if he pulls the thing off without
giving us a chance to see the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be so mean as that, I hope,
Hiram?&rdquo; pleaded Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye take me for?&rdquo; the other had exclaimed,
in seeming indignation. &ldquo;Guess I ought
to know what my duty to my chums is. You&rsquo;ll
all have front seats on the band wagon when the
music begins. Consider that as good as settled,
Tubby. I&rsquo;m having an extra big chair fixed for
you, too, so you&rsquo;ll be comfy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby beamed his gratitude, and as they had
arrived at the turnstile by that time the subject
was dropped.</p>
<p>It was decided that they should keep together,
for a while at least, though anyone could see
that Hiram was wild to hurry over to where the
Golden Gate Aviation Supply Company had its
headquarters adjoining the field where the airships
gave frequent exhibitions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>The crowd had not begun to make itself felt
as yet, so that they found splendid opportunities
to inspect numerous things that attracted
their attention in some of the many immense
Fair buildings.</p>
<p>An hour was spent among the pictures in the
art building. Rob enjoyed this, for he was very
fond of paintings, and at some future date he
meant to put in a whole morning here.</p>
<p>Tubby soon tired of it, and as for Hiram it
seemed to be pretty much of a bore. One whose
heart and mind were wrapped up with all sorts
of inventions could not be expected to content
himself gazing upon works of art; they were too
tame for his spirit; what Hiram delighted in was
the whirr of machinery, the clack of the a&euml;roplane
propeller, and kindred objects that meant
real <i>work</i> for him.</p>
<p>Just how it happened that about the middle
of the morning they found themselves once more
treading the devious ways of the Amusement
Zone neither Rob nor Tubby nor Hiram could
somehow understand. They dimly suspected,
however, that the artful Andy must have managed
to coax them in that quarter under a specious
plea that he wanted to show them something
wonderful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>The first thing they knew they were seated in
chairs on the moving platform, and viewing the
scenery along the stretch of the Panama Canal,
which had a very realistic look for those who
had been there themselves.</p>
<p>Each chair had a dictaphone attachment connected
with the arm, and by applying this in
the proper manner to their ears the occupants
were enabled to hear a description of each section
of the great ditch as it was reached.</p>
<p>Taken in all, it was a novel experience, and
one they enjoyed very much; though in the end
it required the strength of the other three scouts
to drag poor Tubby out of his chair, which happened
not to have been capacious enough for the
standard requirements of the fat boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly,&rdquo; said Tubby, in explanation of his
sticking so tight, &ldquo;I believe some skunk went and
put a piece of shoemakers&rsquo; wax in that chair;
and I feel that I&rsquo;m lucky to have saved the seat
of my new khaki trousers. If it had been the
old ones there&rsquo;s no telling what might have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! a poor excuse is better than none, they
say,&rdquo; muttered Andy; &ldquo;but seems like instead
of calling these chairs comfortable they might
have added that they were the &lsquo;Fat Man&rsquo;s Misery.&rsquo;
But forget it, Tubby; you&rsquo;re safe and
sound again, breeches and all. Come on and see
what there is in this Bedouin Camp. The camels
look like it ought to be a heap interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were not as much taken with the
show as Andy. To him it was all real, and
breathed the atmosphere of the desert and the
traders&rsquo; caravan; but Rob saw how much was
tinsel and make-believe, and really suspected that
some of the so-called Arabs talked among themselves
in pretty fair English.</p>
<p>It happened that shortly after they had issued
from this concession, and Hiram was commencing
to show signs of uneasiness, as though wanting
to be off, something came to pass that for the
time being made them forget their plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! what&rsquo;s all that running about over
there?&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Andy. &ldquo;Mebbe
there&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be an Oriental elopement or a
wedding? Let&rsquo;s hurry over and get in line to
see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n like a dog-fight,&rdquo; grumbled Hiram;
&ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve noticed that in some of these squalid
villages of foreigners they have some ugly yellow
curs hanging around, which I should think
the Fair people wouldn&rsquo;t stand for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same, Hiram ran as fast as his mates
to see what was going on. They made a discovery
before they were more than half way to
the spot. Indeed, the loud outcries borne to their
ears, as well as the smoke that came from a
building where the signs indicated that a celebrated
Egyptian fortune-teller could be consulted,
made this very manifest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! it&rsquo;s a fire!&rdquo; gurgled Tubby, who was
puffing very hard in his effort not to be left in
the lurch by his more agile companions.</p>
<p>The excitement can be easily imagined in that
always thronged section of the Exposition
grounds. Scores of persons, many of them turbaned
Arabs, Turks with red fezzes on their
heads, or other foreigners were rushing this way
and that, all wildly shouting, and wringing
their hands as though they expected that a dreadful
misfortune threatened that part of the
Amusement Zone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>The gayly-dressed fortune-tellers were apparently
up against a hard proposition. They could
pretend to tell what the future held for others,
but apparently had not been able to foresee such
a common everyday occurrence as their booth
taking fire.</p>
<p>No one seemed to be thinking of trying to do
anything. The authorities of the Fair had provided
arrangements for such accidents, and in
due time, doubtless, the fire company would dash
upon the scene, ready to pour a stream of water
on the flames.</p>
<p>But seconds count when fire is seizing hold of
flimsy curtains and woodwork. A minute or two
in the commencement of a conflagration means
that it may be smothered before it gets a firm
clutch on the building.</p>
<p>Rob possibly remembered what had happened
on that Long Island bay at the time he and Andy
saved the naphtha launch owned by old Cap.
Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>Just then he discovered a couple of local scouts
hurrying up. They were small lads, and might
hardly know what was to be done in such an
emergency. Rob seized hold of the first one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, do you know where the nearest fire
extinguisher is fastened; I remember seeing
some around the grounds here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had Rob put this question to the
small scout than his face lighted up eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket!&rdquo; he exclaimed, shrilly. &ldquo;I
knew there was something a fellow ought to do!
Why, yes, there&rsquo;s one right back yonder, mister.
All you got to do is to grab it off the stand and
get busy. I know where another is further on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he darted off, followed by his companion.
Rob had not even waited to hear all
that was said. He had his eye on that little extinguisher
immediately, and was leaping toward
it, followed by the gaze of his admiring chums.</p>
<p>Why, it seemed almost no time at all before
the scout leader had wrenched the extinguisher
loose. His first thought was that luck favored
him because lo! and behold it chanced to be one
of the same pattern he always carried aboard his
little motorboat, to provide against a catastrophe
by fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Thus armed and equipped, Rob started into
the small building from which the dense clouds
of smoke issued, and amidst which tongues of
angry flame were to be seen.</p>
<p>Andy, Hiram and Tubby followed close on his
heels. They had nothing with which to fight the
fire, but somehow seemed to consider it a part of
their duty to back their energetic leader up to the
full limit of their capacity.</p>
<p>It was, after all, nothing of moment, once Rob
got the little stream started on the flames. The
fire had not gained sufficient headway to make
a stubborn resistance of it, and inside of three
minutes Rob had it entirely subdued.</p>
<div class="img" id="p248">
<img src="images/p248.jpg" alt="Inside of three minutes Rob had it entirely subdued." width="500" height="705" />
<p class="center">Inside of three minutes Rob had it entirely subdued.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Back out, fellows; it&rsquo;s all over!&rdquo; he managed
to exclaim, though half choked by the penetrating
smoke.</p>
<p>Just as the scouts came out, and by their smiles
assured everybody that there no longer remained
a spark to endanger the neighboring flimsy structures,
the fire squad came hustling up. Of
course there was a perfect mob gathered by this
time, and Rob found it hard work to try and
make his way through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>The man in charge of the fire-fighters hunted
the scouts up and insisted on shaking hands with
them, a procedure that many in the crowd copied,
greatly to the displeasure of Rob, though Tubby
and the others did not seem to mind it in the
least.</p>
<p>One alert young fellow, who announced that
he was a reporter on a San Francisco daily, tried
his best to get an interview with Rob, who positively
declined to say anything except that they
were scouts from Long Island.</p>
<p>As this persistent newspaperman kept after
them, and was seen in eager conversation with
Tubby in the rear, it might be taken for granted
that the fat scout was of a different mind from
Rob. Trust Tubby to &ldquo;blow the horn&rdquo; good and
strong, especially when he could sing the praises
of one he cared for as much as he did for Rob
Blake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like things keep on happening wherever
we go,&rdquo; said Andy, after they had finally
managed to shake off the last of the curious
crowd, and retreated to another part of the Zone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for some people that such is the
case,&rdquo; asserted Tubby, promptly. &ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t
happened to be around I reckon that fortune-teller&rsquo;s
place would have been burned to the
ground. Some time we may be sorry we bothered
with it. They&rsquo;re all a lot of fakes, say what
you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy chuckled audibly at hearing that remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind Tubby, fellows,&rdquo; he said,
pretending to whisper, though he knew the fat
scout could hear every word plainly; &ldquo;ever since
that time we were down at Coney Island, and a
woman seeress there told him he had a glorious
future as the world&rsquo;s most famous fat man,
Tubby has been sore on the craft. Now, that
same wise woman told me I was going to be
the greatest traveler since Livingstone&rsquo;s time.
She read my longings and aspirations, and I
often think she could lift the curtain and see into
the future.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw! you&rsquo;re silly if you believe a single word
they say!&rdquo; burst out Tubby, with wrath and indignation;
but in less than two minutes he was
as amiable as ever; the unpleasant incident was
forgotten; for Tubby could not stay out of humor
long, and as Hiram was accustomed to saying,
&ldquo;trouble and anger slipped from Tubby just
like water does from a duck&rsquo;s back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>More people were coming as the morning progressed,
though the crowds would not begin to
compare with those that the afternoon and evening
would bring; when the band concerts were an
added attraction, with numerous other events going
on in every direction, until one would wish
they could have a thousand eyes and ears so as
not to miss anything.</p>
<p>Rob was tired of the scenes in the Amusement
Zone, and ready to suggest that all of them make
a change of base, though he knew it would not
be an easy task to tear Andy away from the
sights his heart yearned to keep in contact with.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of the yellow curs we saw in
that Indian village,&rdquo; remarked Tubby; &ldquo;and
some boys are plaguing the life half out of him
by throwing sticks, and trying to round him up.
He must have broken loose from the enclosure
where he was confined, and don&rsquo;t know how to
get back again. Look at the way he acts, will
you? They&rsquo;d better go slow, or he&rsquo;ll bite one of
those sillies! Oh, look at him snapping, will
you, Rob? Makes me think of the mad dog that
ran through our town last&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that talk, Tubby!&rdquo; ordered Rob, sternly;
but apparently it was too late, for some one gave
a shout, and like magic the cry was taken up until
dozens of frightened voices sent it rolling
along the street of the Zone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad dog! mad dog! run for your lives, everybody!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">THE MAD DOG PANIC.</span></h2>
<p>No more dreadful cry can be imagined than
the one the four scouts now heard rising all
around them. It made many faces turn deathly
white, and there was a hasty flight on the part of
the more timid in order to gain the shelter of the
adjoining walls of the booths.</p>
<p>Some boys and men also remained, and commenced
to pelt the wretched cur still further with
stones, sticks, or anything they could lay hands
on, meanwhile keeping up more or less wild
shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fools!&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, indignantly;
&ldquo;that dog is no more mad than I am; but they&rsquo;re
doing everything they can to make him so. He&rsquo;s
already scared half out of his head with all those
things being shied at him. He snarls and snaps
because he&rsquo;s at bay, and the old wolf nature
shows then. All he wants is to get back home
somehow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>The clamor grew in violence as new voices
joined in. Those who came running up, always
eager to see whatever was going on, began to
hurl things at the cringing yellow cur flattened
against the wall; though when the poor beast
once started toward them it was amazing to see
how the mob melted away, men falling over each
other in their frantic fear of being bitten.</p>
<p>Rob was growing more and more indignant.
He tried to speak to some of those nearest him,
but he might as well have tried to stop the flow
of Niagara for all the effect his words of expostulation
had upon the shouters.</p>
<p>Women and children were shrieking in fright,
even though they were apparently safe in the
various buildings that lined the sunny street of
the Zone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t stand for this racket!&rdquo; the others
heard Rob say, as he suddenly left them and
sprang forward.</p>
<p>Immediately loud voices called out, some warning
him not to be rash, and others applauding his
daring, for it is always so easy to stand back and
clap hands when some one is taking the chances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what does Rob mean to do?&rdquo; cried
Tubby, who had seen the mad dog killed in the
main street of Hampton the previous summer,
and had a perfect horror of being brought into
personal contact with any animal suffering from
the rabies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t intending to try and grab the beast!&rdquo;
explained Hiram. &ldquo;Rob knows better than that,
even if the dog is only scared, and not mad. It
would bite him just as quick, I guess, as if it was
rabid. Watch and see what his game is, fellows;
Rob knows what he&rsquo;s about, you&rsquo;d better believe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every eye was centered on the form of the
boy as he advanced toward the cowering dog.
Rob was snapping his fingers, and acting as
friendly as he could, wishing to assure the beast
he had no hostile motive in approaching. This
he did in order to keep the frenzied and tortured
dog from jumping at him before he could manage
to put his little plan into operation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>At least it held the attention of the dog, though
the animal suspected the genuine nature of his
advance, and cowered there watching him, still
snarling viciously.</p>
<p>It required considerable nerve to keep on in
spite of the increasing growls of the dog at bay.
Rob was ready to act in case the beast did spring
toward him, for he certainly had no intention of
allowing its jaws to come in contact with his flesh.</p>
<p>Most of the shouting had died out by now.
Everybody was watching with held breath to
see what that venturesome boy in khaki would
attempt. Many doubtless believed, as they stared
with distended eyes, that Rob actually meant to
grapple with the animal and throttle it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a burning shame to let a boy try what
men might have done!&rdquo; one white-faced woman
near the other scouts was heard to say; and they
could readily imagine that she had boys of her
own at home, of whom she was doubtless thinking
as she watched Rob walking forward into
the danger zone.</p>
<p>But Rob had another scheme in view. Unarmed,
he did not covet an encounter at close
quarters with that yellow dog, whether the
beast was mad or only frenzied with fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>In fact, Rob meant to try and cage him, if it
could be worked. He believed that if given a
chance the dog would only too gladly slip in
through any opening that seemed to offer him
a temporary refuge from all those shouting tormentors.</p>
<p>Rob, in taking a rapid survey of the situation,
had noticed what seemed to be a partly finished
booth which was being erected for some late
coming concession owner. The small building
was almost finished, and had a door, which he
had seen was ajar, though not fully open.</p>
<p>It was the boy&rsquo;s plan, made up on the spur of
the moment, to reach that door and push it wide
open. Then in some fashion perhaps the frightened
dog might be influenced to enter, when the
door could be closed, and thus he would be held
in a trap.</p>
<p>Perhaps Rob&rsquo;s heart beat like a trip-hammer
within him as he came close to that door, and
he fancied he saw the dog starting to jump toward
him. He snapped his fingers again and
spoke kindly. It may be these expressions of
good-will had a little effect on the beast; at any
rate the advance movement was delayed, though
the vicious snarling and whining continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>Then Rob found that he could stretch out his
hand and reach the door. He started to push it
open, though it was no easy task.</p>
<p>Having accomplished this to his satisfaction,
he began to back away, still keeping his eyes on
the dog, and ready to seek some friendly place
of safety in case of necessity.</p>
<p>The dog had seen his action. It must have
known that an avenue of escape had been opened
up by the pushing back of that door. Possibly
the poor beast anticipated a safe return to the
village where it had been at home among its
kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! it&rsquo;s going to accept Rob&rsquo;s invitation!&rdquo;
cried Tubby, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart dog!&rdquo; said Andy; &ldquo;he may save his
bacon by that clever move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes in; now what d&rsquo;ye think of
that for a bright trick?&rdquo; Hiram shouted.</p>
<p>That was just what the badgered dog did&mdash;slipped
along the wall until it came to the partly
open door, and then vanished from view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There goes Rob back! What&rsquo;s he meaning
to do now, I wonder?&rdquo; Tubby exclaimed, in fresh
consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to complete the job by shutting the
door,&rdquo; explained Andy, who could grasp a situation
like this much better than the stout scout,
because his wits worked quicker.</p>
<p>All sounds ceased again as Rob pushed along
the wall of the new building until he could reach
out his hand. Then the door began to close,
faster and faster until the yawning gap was entirely
filled.</p>
<p>Hardly had this been done than there arose a
deafening cheer. Everybody seemed to be wild
with delight, and shook hands with one another
in their excitement. Now that the terrible &ldquo;mad
dog&rdquo; had been caged, plenty of weapons would
be remembered; and it would be so easy, and
safe, to shoot through the windows of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of this, fellows!&rdquo; said Rob,
when he managed to worm his way through the
crush and join his mates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>Tubby frowned as though it was against his
principles to run away when people were wanting
to shake hands, and call one a hero; but not
wanting to be left behind the others, Tubby had
to go.</p>
<p>They had not reached a point far distant when
the report of several firearms reached them. Rob
shook his head and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the silliest thing I ever ran up
against,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The dog was no more mad
than Tubby here is. Those boys pestered him,
and got him scared. Then all that shouting and
waving of hands and throwing of things at him
finished the business. It was a foolish scare, and
I guess nine out of ten mad dog hunts are in the
same class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve finished the poor thing now, I
guess!&rdquo; ventured Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like it the way they&rsquo;re cheering,
just as if they&rsquo;ve done something mighty heroic!&rdquo;
added Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing worth a cheer,&rdquo; remarked
Tubby, emphatically, &ldquo;was when our chum Rob
walked right at the snarling beast, and took all
sorts of chances of getting bit and clawed up.
That needed nerve, let me tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! not any to speak of,&rdquo; said the scout leader,
hastily. &ldquo;I made sure to have my eye on a shed
close by all the while; and if he&rsquo;d really made a
jump for me you&rsquo;d have seen a mighty fine exhibition
of high and lofty climbing. Mad or
not, I wasn&rsquo;t meaning to stay there and tackle
him, without a thing to hit him with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it all worked well, as nearly always happens
with you, Rob,&rdquo; said Tubby; &ldquo;though once
my heart seemed to be up in my throat; that was
when you had to snap your fingers and coax him,
Rob. Only for that he&rsquo;d have made for you,
thinking you meant to strike him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; observed Hiram, shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dog belonged to the Injuns we saw in
the village,&rdquo; ventured Andy, thoughtfully; &ldquo;and
you know Injuns think roast dog is the finest
dish ever. I expect they&rsquo;ll want to claim the remains.
Little they&rsquo;ll bother about any talk of
mad dog; it&rsquo;s more likely to be mad Injun when
they find out what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>And after that they tried to put the latest incident
out of their minds, though Tubby would
explode some new idea concerning it every once
in a while, as they wandered about the Fair
grounds taking in new sights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">TAKING IN THE SIGHTS OF THE FAIR.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s gone, Rob!&rdquo; said Andy, as they
were coming out after an hour spent in the wonderful
Transportation Building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean Hiram?&rdquo; remarked the scout
leader, after taking a comprehensive glance
around. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been expecting him to give
us the slip for some time. He held on longer
than I thought he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble guessing where he&rsquo;s bound for,&rdquo;
laughed Andy. &ldquo;That hall where the latest modern
inventions are on exhibition draws him like
sugar or molasses does the pesky flies in summer
time. He sticks there nearly as hard as&mdash;well,
as Tubby did in that skimpy chair at the
Panama show.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring it nearer home, can&rsquo;t you, Andy, and
say about as well as you <i>want</i> to stick to that
Zone of freaks and flimsies and Coney Island
shows,&rdquo; ventured Tubby, with singular quickness,
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arranged it with Hiram to stay with us
just as long as he could stand for it,&rdquo; explained
Rob; &ldquo;and that when he did feel he had to go,
to call at the little booth of the tobacconist where
we&rsquo;ve arranged to meet, not later than four this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that, you Andy,&rdquo; warned Tubby,
shaking a fat finger in the direction of the other,
&ldquo;in case we <i>happen</i> to get separated! Accidents
will come along sometimes, you know; and you&rsquo;re
likely to feel that call to the wild again any old
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy only laughed. Apparently he had a
tough hide when it came to resisting such harmless
blunt-nosed shafts as Tubby could launch
against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it in mind, Tubby, I promise you,&rdquo;
he remarked; &ldquo;but after we&rsquo;ve had something to
eat, you won&rsquo;t try to keep me any longer. We&rsquo;re
all here to enjoy ourselves according to our
bent, you must remember.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And your bent runs along the line of the
spectacular display of gaudy tinsel and all sorts
of make-believe frauds!&rdquo; continued Tubby, pretending
to curl his short upper lip in disdain,
though truth to tell he rather enjoyed a little
of the same pleasures himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it as you please, Tubby,&rdquo; Andy told
him. &ldquo;To me they&rsquo;re all real, and when I find
myself surrounded by that wonderful foreign
atmosphere, it&rsquo;s just like I&rsquo;d taken wings and
flown over there to Africa, or Asia, or the islands
of the Far East. Rob, make him stop trying to
interfere with my pleasure. Just because one
fortune-teller riled him, Tubby sneers at everything
that wears a Turkish fez, a Bedouin bournoose
or a Persian caftan. I guess I know how
to sift the chaff from the wheat. And a fellow
who means to be a world traveler some day
ought to rub up against these sort of people all
he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby gave it up. He knew nothing he could
say would alter Andy&rsquo;s deep-rooted convictions.
Indeed, it was more to get even with him that
the stout scout spoke as he did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>Later on they hunted up a dining-place where
they could secure a fair meal for their money,
at least as good as was to be expected under the
circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now laugh if you want to, Tubby,&rdquo; said
Andy, boldly, after they had issued forth from
the restaurant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to break away, and
you know where I&rsquo;ll be heading. You keep Rob
company the rest of the day. He&rsquo;s got a list of
things he&rsquo;s fairly itching to see, and it&rsquo;s as long
as my arm, at that. Good luck to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried off without waiting to hear what
Tubby might have to say; but the latter only
shook his head as he caught the amused look in
Rob&rsquo;s eyes, and shrugged his fat shoulders as
though ready to give Andy up as beyond redemption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go and enjoy himself as he feels
like,&rdquo; commented Rob. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s
privilege when they come to a show as tremendous
as this one is. And, Tubby, I think you&rsquo;re
too hard on Andy. I happen to know that he&rsquo;s
been devouring every book on travel and exploration
he can find anywhere. The subject fills
his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then he really does mean to make that his
life work, Rob? I thought it was just a sort of
cloak, as you might say, to cover his wanting to
see these Oriental humbugs carry on. Fortune-tellers
ought to be suppressed by law; they do
lots of harm, I understand, especially where silly
people believe in &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob came very near remarking that, for one
who scorned their class, Tubby himself seemed
to be bothered considerably over a certain foolish
prophecy; but on second thought he concluded
not to add to the color in the fat boy&rsquo;s cheeks
by embarrassing him.</p>
<p>Being now free from the two chums who had
such peculiar and strong notions as to what they
wanted to devote all their time to, Rob and Tubby
started in to spend several hours to the best
possible advantage.</p>
<p>They were not merely seeking amusement, but
instruction as well; and there were copious fountains
to be tapped within the borders of those
extensive grounds of the wonderful Exposition
that would repay the laborer manyfold for his
trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m mighty glad I happened to run
across you, Rob,&rdquo; Tubby remarked, for perhaps
the tenth time, as they watched the process of
the Government fish hatchery, where millions of
eggs were transformed into tiny objects that
looked like animated specks in the water, but
which under proper care would some day be
placed in certain lakes or rivers or in the sea,
to add to the prosperity of the nation that was
fast learning how to conserve its food supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m just as pleased on my own account,&rdquo;
the scout leader told him. &ldquo;You see how my
two chums are bound to desert me, each crazy
along his own particular line, and bound to follow
his pet whim through thick and thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw! then I&rsquo;m the only <i>sensible</i> one of the
lot, seems like!&rdquo; grunted Tubby, with beaming
face. &ldquo;Thank you for intimating as much, Rob.
I do seem to fancy many of the same things
that strike you as worth seeing. &rsquo;Course I sort
of enjoy the humbug of the Zone, but a little goes
a great way. My better nature craves educational
value for the time spent in coming away
out here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>When Tubby said this so grandly he tried very
hard to keep a straight face; but discovering the
gleam of merriment in Rob&rsquo;s eyes, he burst into
a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s part way true, anyhow, Rob,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;I am having a real good time keeping
up with you, even if we&rsquo;re walking miles and
miles, and my shoes are getting to pinch me
something fierce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get somewhere and sit down for a
spell,&rdquo; Rob suggested, for he awoke to the fact
that poor Tubby was not built for getting over
acres and acres of ground with all that flesh to
carry along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, isn&rsquo;t that queer, Rob; but d&rsquo;ye know I
was just going to dare you to go me a plate of
that ice cream over there. We can sit at a table
and get rested while we partake of the stuff.
Excuse me for calling it that, but the chances
are against getting anything first-class when
you&rsquo;re dealing with a man who put up an enormous
sum to pay for his concession, and has to
get it back somehow out of the public.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>They spent almost half an hour there, watching
the crowds and resting. Then as Tubby declared
he felt capable again of almost any exertion,
they resumed their sight-seeing walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice, Rob, that you&rsquo;re working around so
as to come on our meeting-place after a while,&rdquo;
suggested Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was waiting to see if you&rsquo;d pay attention to
that,&rdquo; the other told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to find you
did. A scout must have his eyes on the alert
all the while if he wants to keep up with the
procession, Tubby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m improving right along, Rob; my
folks at home tell me that, too. Time was when
my favorite occupation used to be to stretch and
yawn. All that&rsquo;s changed now, for I yawn and
stretch, you see. This scout business does work
wonders, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>But then everyone knew that Tubby had
changed wonderfully since he joined the troop.
Considering the handicap under which he labored
on account of his size, and the difficulty he had
in doing things that were easy for his chums,
he managed to get along tip-top. Rob always
gave him more credit than the rest when an object
they had been laboring to accomplish had
been attained; because the one who overcomes
the most strenuous barriers deserves greater
praise than those who have not been compelled
to draw upon their reserve powers.</p>
<p>They stood there looking up at the vast Triumphal
Arch of the Setting Sun, which, it seemed
to Tubby, was the most beautiful thing in the
whole Exposition. It appealed to him in a way
he could hardly explain, except that something
seemed to draw him back there again and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, before you came, Rob,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I
used to just haunt this place, together with the
vicinity of the Column of Progress looking out
on the Marino. I&rsquo;ll see them in my dreams long
after all the other effects of the Fair have faded
away. And I reckon now every visitor will somehow
have a certain thing stay with him through
all time, as a memory of the greatest Exposition
that ever was given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step back here, Tubby!&rdquo; said Rob, as he took
hold of the other&rsquo;s sleeve and drew him swiftly
around a corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s all this mean?&rdquo; gasped the stout
boy, looking startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I saw that hustling newspaper man
again,&rdquo; explained Rob, &ldquo;and I was afraid he&rsquo;d
corner us and try to worm out something of our
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! is that all?&rdquo; said Tubby, in disgust.
&ldquo;Why, Rob, honest to goodness now, if I didn&rsquo;t
think it might be another mad dog scare we were
up against.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was something I dislike almost as
much,&rdquo; vowed Rob. &ldquo;And if he ever got <i>you</i>
cornered I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;d give him all the
details about that other little happening that
would make me look silly in the paper. Now he&rsquo;s
gone, and it&rsquo;s safe for us to step out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby shook his head, and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure are the queerest fish ever, Rob,&rdquo; he
observed, with a disappointed air. &ldquo;I never yet
ran across the fellow who wouldn&rsquo;t be only too
glad to see a write-up about him in the paper
where he was called a hero, and all that. Why,
they&rsquo;d hurry off to buy a dozen copies, and mail
the same to all the girls they knew. But say,
whenever you do a thing worth mentioning you
try to sneak away as if it was something to be
ashamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, and that&rsquo;s the only explanation
I can give you, Tubby. Come, let&rsquo;s go into this
building, and then half an hour from now it&rsquo;ll
be time to make for our meeting-place so as to
pick up the other fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Hiram has made up his mind it&rsquo;s about
due to spring his surprise on the company he&rsquo;s
come all the way out here to see and talk with,&rdquo;
Tubby said, as they started into the building
mentioned by Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a hunch that he will, after to-day,
Tubby. I mean to speak with him about it this
very night, and see if it can&rsquo;t be settled to-morrow.
Hiram looks so anxious every little while
it&rsquo;s too bad he doesn&rsquo;t take the bull by the horns
and settle the matter once for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the half-hour was up the two boys issued
forth, and headed in the direction of the tobacconist&rsquo;s
booth, which was not a great way off.
Tubby was again feeling tired, and seemed pretty
well used up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go home as we did last night, right
after eating,&rdquo; suggested Rob. &ldquo;Then to-morrow
we needn&rsquo;t hurry around, for we&rsquo;ll stay until the
gates close at ten, so as to see the illumination,
and the play of the electric fountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me first-rate, though I&rsquo;ve seen all
those things already, and more than once,&rdquo; the
other told the scout leader.</p>
<p>A few minutes later and Tubby burst forth
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the booth we&rsquo;re aiming for, Rob,&rdquo;
he declared; &ldquo;and isn&rsquo;t that our chum Andy walking
up and down like a tiger in its cage? There,
he sees us now, seems like, and he&rsquo;s beckoning.
Let&rsquo;s hurry on,&rdquo; and Tubby actually forgot that
he was tired in his eagerness to learn why the
other was showing such signs of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A note from Hiram that he left here for us,
fellows,&rdquo; Andy hastened to say as the others
reached his side; &ldquo;and he wants us to chase
around there hot-footed, because there&rsquo;s something
big on the bills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">HIRAM FACES THE MUSIC.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Read it out, Rob, please,&rdquo; pleaded Tubby,
with round-eyed wonder.</p>
<p>Thus urged, the scout leader proceeded to
oblige.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what he says here,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Come around to the aviation field as soon as
you possibly can. Something doing. Guess my
chance is knocking at the door like opportunity
that comes once to everybody, they say. Please
<i>hurry</i>!</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;&lsquo;Signed Hiram.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we go, Rob?&rdquo; gasped Tubby, with intense
eagerness in his whole manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without losing a single minute!&rdquo; declared
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should remark,&rdquo; added Andy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been up to our ears interested in this affair of
Hiram&rsquo;s from the day we left home; and we
mean to see him through his troubles to boot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So let&rsquo;s be on the move,&rdquo; suggested Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me,&rdquo; breathed Tubby. &ldquo;You see,
I&rsquo;ve gotten over my tired feeling. There&rsquo;s nothing
can revive a weary scout half so quick as a
chance to get in the swim. Why, I feel as fresh
as a daisy, whatever that can mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, toddle along with us then, Tubby,&rdquo; said
Andy; &ldquo;and take my advice&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk so much
when you&rsquo;re hurrying; it&rsquo;s a bad thing, because
you need every bit of breath you c&rsquo;n get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently Tubby realized this fact for himself,
because he subsided from that moment; all they
heard from him were frequent heavy sighs that
accompanied his strenuous efforts to keep at their
heels.</p>
<p>They knew the way to the aviation field, and
took as direct a course as possible when aiming
for that favorite portion of the grounds. There
could always be found a large crowd watching
the bird-men in their preparations for going
aloft, and making landings after showing what
their airships were capable of doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>As a rule most of the spectators were debarred
from getting too close to the a&euml;roplanes,
for many reasons; but Hiram had made himself
so useful on former occasions that no one questioned
his right inside the ropes. So also the
other three scouts would doubtless be allowed to
loiter near the starting point, where there were
always a dozen or two air-pilots gathered, comparing
notes and joking each other after the
manner of daring adventurers, which all of them
undoubtedly are, since they take their lives in
their hands every time they ascend.</p>
<p>Hiram was waiting for them on the border of
the great throng of deeply interested spectators.
They saw immediately that the inventor scout
was very much worked up over something or
other, and naturally all of the other boys were
deeply curious to know what had happened to
excite him.</p>
<p>Hiram was evidently on the lookout for his
three chums, since he beckoned them over as
soon as he caught their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo; said Tubby, breathlessly,
as they lined up alongside the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell us what&rsquo;s in the wind!&rdquo; added Andy,
impatiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something has happened,&rdquo; began Hiram,
mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said that in your note,&rdquo; grumbled Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Company,&rdquo; Hiram continued, &ldquo;have been
waiting for me to show up, and they&rsquo;re just so
eager to find out what my stabilizer can do that
they can&rsquo;t stand for the delay any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great governor! they don&rsquo;t mean to steal your
idea, I hope?&rdquo; asked Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I guess not!&rdquo; replied the other, calmly.
&ldquo;You see they&rsquo;ve applied it to one of their best
machines to give it a try-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully! that suits you all right!&rdquo; urged Andy,
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say yes!&rdquo; declared Hiram, with a
wide grin. &ldquo;And if you crane your necks right
now so as to rubber and look up you&rsquo;ll see that
same a&euml;roplane soaring along there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That monoplane you mean, don&rsquo;t you,
Hiram?&rdquo; asked Andy, after all of them had
taken a good look to where the other was pointing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, she&rsquo;s the one, and my stabilizer&rsquo;s
aboard,&rdquo; Hiram went on to tell them, with a
pardonable touch of pride in his voice, though
he was careful that no one else should hear him
speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they tried it out yet, d&rsquo;ye know?&rdquo; inquired
Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the pilot&rsquo;s just starting in now to see
what she can do,&rdquo; he was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Did you see him tumble then?&rdquo; ejaculated
the fat boy, gripping Hiram&rsquo;s arm nervously
as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was looping the loop,&rdquo; explained the
inventor; &ldquo;lots of pilots c&rsquo;n do that trick nowadays;
why, I&rsquo;ve heard that Beachey even makes
two complete turns. That bird-man up there is
second only to Beachey, I&rsquo;m told. Watch some
more of his bold stunts; and hold your breath,
Tubby, for he&rsquo;ll give you lots of thrills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got to breathe, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; complained
the fat scout, who was already unduly
red in the face from his exertions in this line.</p>
<p>They watched the aviator go through a number
of hazardous exploits. It was doubtless generally
known among the pilots assembled that he
was testing some new idea, for he seemed to be
closely observed by everybody within the
enclosure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>Hiram could see that some of the bird-men
were pleased, for they nodded their heads as they
exchanged remarks. Fancy how this fact thrilled
the boy, for it was <i>his</i> invention that interested
these veterans among air-pilots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I kind of guess he&rsquo;s exhausted every
trick he knows, and is goin&rsquo; to come down,&rdquo; said
Hiram, presently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be gettin&rsquo; inside,
for I want to be as close as I can when he
makes his report to the folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly he led his chums inside the roped
enclosure. He seemed to have made good with
the attendants, for they smiled and nodded to
Hiram. That Yankee &ldquo;gift of gab&rdquo; which
Hiram possessed was very apt to get him into
the good graces of those upon whom he chose
to exercise it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>The scouts presently found themselves in close
touch with many of the participants in the exhibitions
that were hourly taking place. Here
were men famous in their line, from aviators to
makers of machines. Here also had collected
those who were interested in the future of aviation,
and thinking more or less seriously of embarking
in the business.</p>
<p>As may be expected, the talk was &ldquo;shop&rdquo; every
minute of the time. No matter what terrible
distress the war over in Europe might be causing,
these enthusiasts could only think and speak of
matters that were connected with the game of
rivaling the birds in their flights. If they mentioned
the battles that were taking place day in
and day out, it was only in connection with the
exploits of the aviation corps on the side of the
French, the German, the British or the Belgian
armies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that gentleman with the white mustache,
the one that looks like a Kentucky colonel, or an
army officer?&rdquo; whispered Hiram. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
the head of the Golden Gate Aviation Supply
Company, and the person I expect to do business
with pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine looking gentleman, I must say,&rdquo;
admitted Rob. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll have no trouble
making fair terms with him, if I&rsquo;m any judge of
faces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that, Rob,&rdquo; breathed
Hiram, with a sigh, &ldquo;because one minute I think
everything looks rosy, and the next I&rsquo;m groveling
in the dust. But the agony will soon be over.
There, he means to land this time; get ready to
stick by me, because I want to be near when
he climbs out of his seat and meets that boss of
the whole company face to face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monoplane came swooping down, and like
a great bird with wings extended, sailed along
close to the ground, with constantly decreasing
speed, as the power had been shut off.</p>
<p>Now the wheels under the frame had come
in contact with the ground, and a dozen eager
hands were outstretched to bring the machine to
a full stop on the border of the group. This
assemblage was being constantly augmented by
fresh arrivals, all eager to pass the good word
with the pilot, and possibly congratulate him on
the fine showing he had just made.</p>
<p>Hiram was looking as sharp as a fox as he
strained his ears to catch every syllable that the
air-man uttered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>He leisurely climbed out of his seat and
reached the ground. There was a satisfied smile
on his face that sent a wave of delight to the
anxious heart of the waiting boy, to whom the
success or failure of this, his first real invention,
meant so much.</p>
<p>The pilot looked around. He was evidently
expecting to make an immediate report to the
gentleman with the white mustache, and Hiram
had been very careful to keep in close touch
with that man.</p>
<p>Yes, the pilot, after exchanging a little badinage
with some of his comrades, immediately
pushed directly toward the spot where the four
chums stood. Straight up to the head of the
large firm by whom he was employed the bird-man
strode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is the decision?&rdquo; Hiram heard the
gentleman say, a note of anticipation in his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly favorable, Mr. Curley. In fact,
with only one trial I am convinced that it is
going to be the best stabilizer so far on the market.
You have made no mistake, take my word
for it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>Rob almost feared Hiram was going to faint.
He leaned so heavily against him, as though for
the moment his heart had ceased to beat. And
yet, strange to say, the very first thing the overjoyed
inventor did was to turn and clap his mouth
close to the ear of the scout leader and mutter
in trembling tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jinks! Did you hear <i>that</i>, Rob? Say, I
meant to ask &rsquo;em just twenty-five hundred cash
for the patent, but she&rsquo;s doubled in price now.
And don&rsquo;t you think they&rsquo;ll pay the five thousand
all right, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yankee in Hiram was on tap, Rob saw
with amusement. At the same time he hastened
to assure his chum that he was well within his
rights in demanding all he thought he could get
for his cunning device.</p>
<p>Evidently Hiram had determined to break the
ice while the opportunity lay within his reach.
Long had he waited for this glorious moment to
arrive. By day he had pictured it in a dozen
fantastic forms, and while he slept his dreams
must have carried him through numerous interviews
with the powers that swayed the fortunes
of the wonderful Golden Gate Aviation Supply
Company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>He pushed forward a little further. If some
of those present noticed the boy in scout uniform
they paid little attention to him, being taken up
with what was passing between the pilot and the
builder.</p>
<p>So Hiram managed to squeeze himself along
until he could put out his hand and actually touch
the two central figures in the discussion.</p>
<p>Rob and the other boys were not quite so fortunate,
but being within easy hearing distance,
they believed they would not be apt to miss anything
that went on.</p>
<p>They saw Hiram put out his hand and give a
tug at the coat of the fine-looking gentleman with
the white military mustache. The latter looked
down and was apparently annoyed to see that it
was only a youth who sought to distract his
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, boy?&rdquo; he was heard to
ask, impatiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>Then Hiram spoke up. If his voice quavered
a little that was not surprising; indeed, in Rob&rsquo;s
mind the wonder was that the excited scout could
find his tongue at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, Mr. Curley, that the little
stabilizer has proved to be all that was claimed
for it, sir?&rdquo; was what Hiram asked.</p>
<p>The gentleman stared hard at him. Others
who heard his question did the same, and Rob saw
a smile as of amusement appear on the bronzed
face of the noted air-pilot who had just come
down, after experimenting with the device, bringing
a favorable report; it was as though he had
begun to smell a rat, and realized what a joke
it would be to have a boy invent such an important
appendage to a heavier-than-air flying
machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what business is that of yours, may I
ask, boy?&rdquo; demanded the business head of the
big company, as he continued to stare at the
eager, flushed face of the lad who wore the
khaki of a Boy Scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Because I happen to be the Hiram Nelson
you&rsquo;ve been corresponding with, sir, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
said Hiram. &ldquo;I used the money you sent me to
come out here, but was a leetle bit afraid to face
you. But I guess it&rsquo;s all right now, Mr. Curley,
because I heard your pilot say the thing worked
fine. That suits me; and I&rsquo;m ready to talk terms
with you right away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">A BOY SCOUT&rsquo;S TRIUMPH.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this you are telling me?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Curley, quickly. &ldquo;Have you the proof of what
you claim with you, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob noticed that it was no longer &ldquo;boy&rdquo; with
the gentleman; Hiram was evidently climbing in
the scales, and rapidly at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, I&rsquo;ve got everything to show
you; and my patent right papers are in the hotel
safe ready to be turned over in case we can
reach a bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman looked hastily around him.
There were representatives of other makers of
a&euml;roplanes present who might endeavor to bid
against him if only they knew he did not as yet
have any positive agreement with the inventor
of that successful stabilizer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please say no more until we are in my office,
Mr. Nelson,&rdquo; he remarked, softly; &ldquo;and if you
have the time now we might as well adjourn
there. I&rsquo;ll ask a few of my people to accompany
us, as well as this pilot who has just given your
little trick its first try out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to enter into a talk with you, Mr.
Curley,&rdquo; declared Hiram; &ldquo;but I must insist that
my friends, who have come out to the Coast with
me, be along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He beckoned to Rob and Andy and Tubby,
who immediately started to push their way
through the crowd to where Hiram and the gentleman
with the white mustache stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, it is only fair that you should have
equal backing with us,&rdquo; observed the gentleman,
whose eyes twinkled with amusement now, as he
began to grasp the situation, and realize that
his company was up against a boy who knew
his rights, and was possessed of considerable
business sagacity, as well as inventive talent.</p>
<p>Accordingly they all headed for some buildings
not a great ways off, and thus it came that presently
the scouts found themselves behind closed
doors with Mr. Curley and a number of others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>The head of the manufacturing firm was
frowning a trifle, Rob noticed, even if there were
times when he allowed a trace of a smile to
steal across his face on glancing down at the
figure of Hiram Nelson. Rob knew why this
should be so, and he considered that it was only
natural.</p>
<p>As a shrewd business man Mr. Curley realized
that Hiram had been too smart for them. Instead
of announcing his presence immediately,
and taking what they chose to offer him for his
clever device, the young Yankee inventor had
hung around and waited for the climax to come.
He had heard the favorable report made by the
bird-man, and of course that had strengthened
his case.</p>
<p>The gentleman understood that this unfortunate
happening was likely to cost them dearly,
since the inventor, knowing the value of his patent,
would be likely to hold out for a much larger
sum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you will let me see some papers to
prove your identity, Mr. Nelson, we will talk
shop with you; and I might as well confess in
the beginning that if you are inclined to treat us
fairly we can come to terms with you; but please
consider that only one trial has been given to
your stabilizer; and it may, after all, be of less
value than appears at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram needed no second invitation to get busy.
He immediately unloaded a mass of proof upon
them to show he was all he claimed, and that he
also had the papers connected with his patent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied, so far as that goes,&rdquo; announced
the gentleman, as though desirous of arriving at
the most important part of the whole proceedings
as soon as possible. &ldquo;Now will you please
state the very lowest cash price you will accept
to turn the patent over to this company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand dollars, sir!&rdquo; replied Hiram
promptly.</p>
<p>Rob was watching the other&rsquo;s face. He saw
something there that told him Hiram had at least
not exceeded the amount which would have been
reckoned a price limit for the invention. Mr.
Curley, however, was too good a business man
to show any eagerness in the transaction, though
there was certainly a gleam of satisfaction in
his eyes as he seemed to consider the offer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to be frank with you, Mr. Nelson,&rdquo;
he remarked, presently. &ldquo;The sum you
mention, although somewhat larger than we had
contemplated paying for an invention the value
of which has still to be fully proved, is within
the amount we could afford to risk in the hopes
of getting a really dependable stabilizer. Now,
if we agree to do business with you, would you
consent to sign a paper here and now to turn
over your patent right entirely to us on the
receipt of the sum you mention, five thousand
dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiram was holding his own remarkably well.
He refused to show any signs of being overwhelmed
by his great good fortune, and seemed
to be capable of displaying his customary shrewd
Yankee bargaining qualities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll agree to do it, Mr. Curley,&rdquo; he said deliberately,
&ldquo;if your company also makes the bargain
so it can&rsquo;t be broken. It mustn&rsquo;t bind only
me. Pay a certain sum in hand, and agree to
give me the balance to-morrow, and I&rsquo;ll sign the
paper you speak of, handing over the patent
rights transferred to you when the balance is
put in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strictly business acumen, Mr. Nelson,&rdquo;
said the gentleman, now smiling broadly, for
there was no longer any danger of a backdown,
and the wonderful little invention could not be
taken away from them by some rival and wealthy
company; &ldquo;and with your permission, then, here
is an agreement, in duplicate, with the amount
left blank, which I will fill in according to your
proposition; and if everything is agreeable, we
will both sign it in proper form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the agreement, filled out
as settled upon, was handed to Hiram to look
over before signing. He immediately backed
over to where his three comrades stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to go over it word for word with
me, Rob, and if there&rsquo;s any sort of hitch or trap,
tell me; though I don&rsquo;t expect to find that sort of
thing, because I guess Mr. Curley is too straight
a gentleman to try and take advantage of a
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They weighed every sentence, and fortunately
the agreement was very simple, so it was easily
understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Rob?&rdquo; asked Hiram, trying to
control himself as best he could, for he knew
curious eyes were upon him, and he did not want
any of the men to believe this was his first venture
in the realm of finance, which in fact was
the actual truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be all right, Hiram, and I wouldn&rsquo;t
hesitate to sign it,&rdquo; the scout leader advised him.
&ldquo;If you want a witness allow me to put my
signature on it. I&rsquo;ll be proud to know that I&rsquo;ve
had something to do with your first real success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to do!&rdquo; echoed Hiram, with considerable
emotion, &ldquo;why, Rob, you&rsquo;ve been my
backbone up to now. Only for you I&rsquo;d have
made a botch of the hull thing. I owe you more&rsquo;n
I c&rsquo;n ever tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went back to where Mr. Curley was waiting,
a little anxiously Rob saw, as if he feared
Hiram might be overcome with greed, and attempt
to boost the price he had already named.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see you agree to give me a check for five
hundred dollars right now, Mr. Curley,&rdquo; Hiram
commenced, &ldquo;to bind the bargain with. Well,
I would be tempted to say I didn&rsquo;t want you to
do that, but I know it&rsquo;s a poor thing to refuse
money in hand, and also that it fixes it so neither
of us can back out. So I&rsquo;ll accept the sum, sir,
and sign the agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he hastened to do, and Rob was called on
to add his name as a witness; then other names
were placed upon the agreement, as well as the
duplicate which was to be given into the possession
of Hiram as the other party.</p>
<p>When that check for five hundred dollars was
placed in Hiram&rsquo;s hand he smiled, and then coolly
doubling it up, placed it carefully away in his
pocketbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, for a beginning, isn&rsquo;t so bad, Mr. Curley,&rdquo;
he said, as the gentleman was shaking
hands cordially with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m meaning to use
every cent of this money to advance several little
schemes I&rsquo;ve got started. Only for my need
of cash to push them along mebbe you mightn&rsquo;t
have got that stabilizer without a few bids from
other companies; but you sure treated me white,
Mr. Curley, and I wanted you to know I appreciate
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>Possibly Mr. Curley may have thought that
Hiram had worked a pretty sharp trick on them
in hanging around, and learning what they
thought about his invention before disclosing his
identity; but then certain things are allowable
in business, and at least he had shown himself
capable of looking after his own interests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any of your later ideas happen to be in line
with our work, Mr. Nelson,&rdquo; the head of the
firm said, &ldquo;I hope you will give us a look at them
before you approach any rival company. In one
way it is a good thing for an inventor to keep
advancing with the firm who first patronized
him, of course, granting that they will meet any
price he may be offered elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I c&rsquo;n promise you that, sir,&rdquo; said
Hiram, who was very happy, and at that moment
felt drawn toward the fine-looking gentleman
who had treated him so splendidly.</p>
<p>So the four boys wended their way toward
the gates of the Exposition. Hiram hardly knew
whether he was walking on air or on ground.
It seemed to him that his heels must be made of
some magical rubber that kept pace with his ecstasy
of mind, for he came near dancing at times,
much to the amusement of Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>&ldquo;First thing for me to do, fellows,&rdquo; Hiram
said, as they reached the hotel, &ldquo;is to send a
night letter to my folks telling &rsquo;em that I&rsquo;ve got
the coin. My maw she believed in me right
along, but dad he&rsquo;s allers been kinder skeptical,
you know, and used to say I was spendin&rsquo; heaps
of money on foolishness. Guess he&rsquo;s due to
change his tune after this, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob found that there had been a telegram for
him that morning which somehow he had failed
to receive before leaving for the Exposition
grounds. It was a night letter from Professor
McEwen in answer to the one he had sent, signed
by the name of Professor Marsh, who was in
charge of the exhibit.</p>
<p>In this communication, limited to fifty words,
the Edinburgh scientist tried to express the deep
satisfaction he felt because Rob and Andy had
successfully filled his place, and handed over
that precious packet to the gentleman in charge,
without any accident. He declared that he would
remain until their return home, and that he hoped
to be able to thank them again most heartily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>The boys were a happy lot that evening. They
attended a theater where there was an instructive
show well worth seeing by all scouts. Indeed,
Hiram seemed to have actually grown two inches
since morning.</p>
<p>Of course his chums gloried in his success;
so that the rest of their stay at the City of the
Great Exposition was likely to be one long picnic,
with not a single hovering cloud to mar
their pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">HOMEWARD BOUND.</span></h2>
<p>On the following day, at the appointed hour,
Hiram and his three chums turned up at the
offices of the Golden Gate Aviation Supply Company,
where the final exchanges were made.
Hiram handed over his papers to the new owners
of his invention, and received their check for
the balance of the purchase price.</p>
<p>At Rob&rsquo;s solicitation he proceeded to the city
and opened an account at a bank, against which
he could check from time to time as he needed
cash in pursuing his work.</p>
<p>Then, having now relieved themselves of all
source of worry and anxiety, the four Eagle Patrol
members gave themselves up to the full enjoyment
of their holiday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>What wonders they continued to see as they
daily visited the great Fair, would take volumes
to describe. New and amazing things were constantly
cropping up as they prowled hither and
thither through devious ways that up to then
they possibly did not know existed. There was
a constant succession of surprises awaiting them
with each new day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I honestly believe,&rdquo; Tubby declared
many times as they discovered some display that
up to then had eluded them, &ldquo;everything that
was thought of in the whole world must be included
in the exhibits inside this enclosure. I&rsquo;ll
never get over being thankful to Uncle Mark
for fetching me here. And to think that I was
given a chance to be with the dearest chums any
scout ever had&mdash;that&rsquo;s a whole lot the best thing
of it all. Oh, it was certainly my lucky day
when I decided to go up on that A&euml;roscope, because
only for that we never might have met at
all; and just think what I would have missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sight of Hiram here winning his prize
for one thing; that was a spectacle for sore eyes,
let me tell you!&rdquo; remarked Andy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all
proud of him, and we want him to know it too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was that fire scare,&rdquo; said Hiram,
&ldquo;when Rob got the blaze smothered with that
little extinguisher before the regular department
arrived on the spot&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget to count that
as something, Tubby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the mad dog chase, with our leader again
demonstrating what a scout should be able to
do when an emergency arises,&rdquo; Andy added.
&ldquo;The poor dog got shot, but there was no human
being injured in the panic, which there might
have been only for the handsome way Rob coaxed
the cur to slip inside that inclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Tubby, anxious to display his
view, &ldquo;and we don&rsquo;t want to forget about Jared
Applegate, either. He gave us something of a
racket, you remember, by sneaking into that
room at the hotel, and hiding under your bed
when he heard us coming along the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me laugh when I remember how
he almost licked Rob&rsquo;s hand, and promised to be
good if only he was let go,&rdquo; said Hiram, rather
disdainfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds as if you didn&rsquo;t have much faith
in Jared&rsquo;s promises to reform?&rdquo; said Rob, smilingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He never meant a word of it, and I know it!&rdquo;
declared Hiram. &ldquo;I could see the nasty snap in
his eyes just like they used to be. Haven&rsquo;t we
known him to crawl and make all sorts of big
promises before, but always to break the same
the first chance he had? Huh! that money in
his pocket was never earned honestly, I&rsquo;d like
to wager; and it won&rsquo;t be used either to carry
him back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, he&rsquo;s left the hotel, which is one
good thing,&rdquo; said Rob. &ldquo;I thought it was my
business to find out this morning, for as we knew
him to be a thief it hardly seemed fair to keep
quiet, and not put a flea in the ear of the management
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saved you the trouble then by skipping
out?&rdquo; remarked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose he imagined we might tell on
him as a duty, and thought he had better leave
between two days,&rdquo; Rob explained. &ldquo;Of course,
when I learned he had thrown up his job, been
paid off, and was gone, I concluded it was no use
saying anything more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not Jared&rsquo;s been doing more than
one shady job since he came here,&rdquo; suggested
Hiram, shrewdly, &ldquo;and he was afraid they&rsquo;d take
him to task for the same, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps shut him up in a
cell; so he concluded to get away while the going
was good. Well, here&rsquo;s hoping we may never
run across the snake again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; ventured Tubby. &ldquo;Seems like
there&rsquo;s some queer fatality about it, but we do
come on that scamp in the most re<i>mark</i>able ways.
There he was down in Mexico, and before that at
Panama. To think that he&rsquo;d be out here where
the Big Show&rsquo;s going on, and of all places acting
as a porter in the very hotel where we took up
our quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The pitcher that goes once too often to the
well comes to grief,&rsquo; they say,&rdquo; mentioned Rob.
&ldquo;If Jared keeps on bobbing up as he has been doing,
and getting in our way, he&rsquo;ll rue it some time
or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the days came and went, Rob and his three
chums certainly managed to have the time of
their lives. If there was one part of that mammoth
Exposition that they failed to investigate
it was not because they wasted any of their
time; at least this could be said for Rob and
Tubby, who were most energetic in making the
grand rounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>As was to be expected, the other two were so
wedded to their idols that it was not an easy
task to tear them away; and at times Rob had
to insist on their accompanying himself and
Tubby to other parts of the inclosure.</p>
<p>Andy never tired of watching the quaint
scenes in the Zone, where the tides of humanity
from all over the world ebbed and flowed through
all the hours of the day and evening. He dearly
loved to just imagine himself in far-distant
lands, close in touch with these brown or yellow
people. And the resolution to become a world
traveler when he grew to manhood seized hold
of Andy with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>As for Hiram, he could not be blamed for
haunting that section where his heart found the
greatest charm of the entire Exposition. Here
he pored over the various ingenious inventions
fashioned in the clever brains of the foremost
among the nation&rsquo;s talented men and women,
from Edison down to the most humble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>And Hiram, having already reaped the fruits
of his first venture in this fascinating field of
human endeavor, naturally looked forward to the
time when perhaps his name, too, might be linked
with those for which he felt such reverence.</p>
<p>When Tubby&rsquo;s uncle returned he was well satisfied
to go East alone and leave his nephew in
such good hands.</p>
<p>During the remainder of their stay in San
Francisco the boys never once caught a glimpse
of Jared Applegate. If he still remained in the
City he made it a point to religiously avoid meeting
any of his former school companions.</p>
<p>Rob had determined that he might let the
crabbed old farmer and his wife know they had
met Jared while on the Coast, so as to ease their
minds, if they had not heard from their bad son
for a long while, though he decided he would
say nothing about the deplorable circumstances
under which the meeting had taken place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never liked the old farmer and his wife,&rdquo;
Rob had said to the others, when they were discussing
the matter their last evening at the Fair,
sitting at their ease, disposing of some ice cream,
and watching the throng pass by. &ldquo;But I suppose
they have feelings like the rest of us, and
in their own way, care for their boy. It would
only give them a new stab to be told that Jared
was as bad as ever, and do no good; so I hope
none of you will whisper anything about that
little episode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being true scouts, and with malice toward
none, the others readily agreed to do as Rob
asked. They could easily afford to forget that
unpleasant adventure, since things had turned
out so wonderfully well for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that this is our last night at
the Exposition,&rdquo; said Tubby, with a vein of despondency
in his voice. &ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m awfully
sorry, much as I want to see the folks at home
again. I&rsquo;ll never, never forget all I&rsquo;ve seen out
here, let me tell you; for even if half of the
civilized world is at war and killing each other
off by tens of thousands each day, you&rsquo;d never
know it in this beautiful land of peace and
plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear! Tubby&rsquo;s getting poetical!&rdquo; exclaimed
Andy, pretending to pound on the table
with his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s enough to stir anybody up that&rsquo;s
got a soul for things besides old fakers with red
fezzes and turbans, who make out to be fortune-tellers
from Egypt and such places, when the
fact is they were born in Cork or Hoboken!&rdquo; the
other shot back at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the greatest Fair that ever was held,&rdquo;
said Rob. &ldquo;When we get back home to Hampton
we&rsquo;ll tell every boy we know that if he has
a chance to come out here and fails to take advantage
of the same, he&rsquo;s missing the treat of
his life, barring none!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all can subscribe to what you say, Rob,&rdquo;
agreed Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; continued the scout leader.
&ldquo;Think of the things we&rsquo;ve been allowed to put
through. There was the fetching of that fragile
exhibit all the way across the continent, without
any accident. And Hiram here has struck
the first round on the ladder of fame. Even
that doesn&rsquo;t exhaust the list of our pleasures,
because we&rsquo;ve still got another treat before us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning the homeward trip, I guess?&rdquo; ventured
Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when we find ourselves among the
mighty Rocky Mountains that the Canadian Pacific
Railroad climbs in passing from Vancouver
to the East, we can feast our eyes on the grandest
natural mountain scenery of the world. As for
me, I&rsquo;m anxious for the time to come when we&rsquo;ll
be enjoying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were starting for Vancouver in the
morning, with the intention of passing over the
railroad line that pierced the famous Selkirks, it
would seem that Rob would not have long to
possess his soul in patience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>And since they finished with the Great Panama-Pacific
Exposition on going to their hotel that
night, it would seem that this is the proper place
for us to say good-by to the four chums. But
while our story must end here, there can be no
telling what the future may have in store for
Rob and his comrades of the Eagle Patrol; and
if fortune is kind enough to throw them in the
way of further adventures and triumphs, we
hope ours may be the pen selected to place these
events before the readers who have so long accompanied
them in their numerous journeys.</p>
